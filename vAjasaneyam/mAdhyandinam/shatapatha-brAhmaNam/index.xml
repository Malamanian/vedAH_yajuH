      <description>The ceremonies begin with the preparation of the sacrificial fires. [First, the fivefold lustration successively of the Āhavanīya and Dakshiṇāgni fire-places, to render them fit for receiving the fire from the Gārhapatya or householder&amp;rsquo;s fire, viz. by thrice sweeping the hearths; thrice besmearing them with gomaya; drawing three lines across them from west to east, or south to north, with the wooden sword (sphya); removing the dust from the lines with the thumb and ring-finger; and thrice sprinkling the lines with water 1.</description>

      <description>01  Verily, by means of the Varuṇapraghāsāḥ Prajāpati delivered the creatures from Varuṇa&amp;rsquo;s noose; and those creatures of his were born without disease and blemish. Now with these Sākamedha offerings,&amp;ndash;therewith indeed the gods slew Vr̥tra, therewith they gained that supreme authority which they now wield; and so does he now therewith slay his wicked, spiteful enemy and gain the victory: this is why he performs these offerings in the fourth month (after the Varuṇapraghāsāḥ).</description>

      <description>01  Prajāpati alone, indeed, existed here in the beginning. He considered, &amp;lsquo;How may I be reproduced?&amp;rsquo;  He toiled and performed acts of penance. He generated Agni from his mouth; and because he generated him from his mouth, therefore Agni is a consumer of food: and, verily, he who thus knows Agni to be a consumer of food, becomes himself a consumer of food.
02 He thus generated him first (agre) of the gods; and therefore (he is called) Agni, for agni (they say) is the same as agri.</description>

      <description>01  Now the living beings once approached Prajāpati&amp;ndash;beings doubtless mean creatures&amp;ndash;and said, &amp;lsquo;Ordain unto us in what manner we are to live!&amp;rsquo; Thereupon the gods, being properly invested with the sacrificial cord 1 and bending the right knee, approached him. To them he said, &amp;lsquo;The sacrifice (shall be) your food; immortality your sap; and the sun your light!&amp;rsquo;  02 Then the fathers approached, wearing the cord on the right shoulder, and bending the left knee.</description>

      <description>01  Now Kahoḍa Kaushītaki spake, &amp;lsquo;This sap (of the plants) truly belongs to those two, heaven and earth: having offered of this sap to the gods, we will eat it.&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;That is why the offering of first-fruits is performed.&amp;rsquo;  02 And Yājñavalkya also spake:&amp;ndash;The gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Prajāpati, once contended for superiority. The Asuras then defiled, partly by magic, partly with poison, both kinds of plants&amp;ndash;those on which men and beasts subsist&amp;ndash;hoping that in this way they might over come the gods.</description>

      <description>01  Now by means of the sacrifice the gods ascended to heaven. But the god who rules over  the cattle was left behind here: hence they call him Vāstavya, for he was then left behind on the (sacrificial) site 1 (vāstu).
02 The gods went on worshipping and toiling with the same (sacrifice) by which they had ascended to heaven. Now the god who rules over the cattle, and who was left behind here,&amp;ndash;  03 He saw (what occurred, and said), &amp;lsquo;I have been left behind: they are excluding me from the sacrifice!</description>

      <description>01  When Indra had hurled the thunderbolt at Vr̥tra, thinking himself to be the weaker, and fearing lest he had not brought him down, he concealed himself and went to the farthest distances 1. Now the gods knew that Vr̥tra had been slain and that Indra had concealed himself.  02 Agni of the deities, Hiraṇyastūpa 2 of the R̥shis, and the Br̥hatī of the metres, set about searching for him.</description>

      <description>01  He now separates the two spoons (juhū and upabhr̥t), with the text (Vāj. S. II, 15 a), &amp;lsquo;May I be victorious after the victory of Agni and Soma! with the impetus of the (sacrificial) food I urge myself on.&amp;rsquo; With his right hand he moves the juhū eastwards (from its usual place on the prastara-bunch upon the altar), with the text (ib. b), &amp;lsquo;May Agni and Soma drive him away who hates us, and whom  we hate!</description>

      <description>01  They now remove two burning samidhs (from the Āhavanīya fire). That fire, indeed, is now worn out, (and therefore useless) for the after-offerings, since it has been carrying the sacrifice to the gods: &amp;lsquo;Let us perform the after-offerings in such (fire) as is not out-worn!&amp;rsquo; thus they think, and for this reason they remove those two burning samidhs (from the fire).  02 Thereupon they again move them close (to the fire).</description>

      <description>01  Verily, whoever exists, he, in being born, is born as (owing) a debt to the gods, to the R̥shis, to the fathers, and to men 1.  02 For, inasmuch as he is bound to sacrifice, for that reason he is born as (owing) a debt to the gods: hence when he sacrifices to them, when he makes  offerings to them, he does this (in discharge of his debt) to them.</description>

      <description>Here also two days were, as a rule, required for the performance, both at full and new moon; but while, at the ordinary sacrifice,
At full moon some authorities add a special ishṭi to Indra Vimr̥dh (&amp;rsquo;the Averter of evil&amp;rsquo;). The new-moon performance concludes with libations of whey to the divine coursers (the horses of the gods); and, optionally, with an ishṭi to Āditya.
The performance of the Dākshāyaṇa sacrifice was held to be obligatory only for a period of fifteen years (see XI, 1, 2, 13), whereas the ordinary new and full-moon offerings had to be performed for double that period from the setting up of the sacred fires.</description>

      <description>01  With the fire-wood (idhma, lighting material) the Adhvaryu lights (indh) the fire: hence it is called fire-wood. And with the kindling verses (sāmidhenī) the Hotr̥ kindles (sam-indh, to make blaze): hence they are called kindling verses.  02 He (the Adhvaryu 1) says (to the Hotr̥): &amp;lsquo;Recite to the fire as it is being kindled!&amp;rsquo; for it is to the fire, when it is being kindled, that he recites.</description>

      <description>01  When he has taken out the Āhavanīya fire 1, he performs the Full-offering 2. The reason why  he performs the full-offering is that he thereby causes that Agni to become an eater of food for his own self; that he thereby offers food to him. Even as (a mother or cow) would offer the breast to a new-born child or calf, so does he thereby offer food to him.</description>

      <description>01  Being about to perform the patnīsaṁyājas 1, they betake themselves back to the Gārhapatya fire. The Adhvaryu takes the juhū and sruva, the Hotr̥ the veda, and the Āgnīdhra the butter-(melting) pot.  02 Here now the Adhvaryu, according to some, passes the Āhavanīya on the east side. Let him not, however, do this; for were he to walk on that side, he would be outside the sacrifice.  03 According to others, the Adhvaryu walks (so as to pass) behind the (sacrificer&amp;rsquo;s) wife 2.</description>

      <description>01  Fourfold, namely, was Agni (fire) at first. Now that Agni whom they at first chose for the office of Hotr̥ priest passed away. He also whom they chose the second time passed away. He also whom they chose the third time passed away 1. Thereupon the one who still constitutes the fire in our own time, concealed himself from fear. He entered into the waters.

      <description>01  Now the Seasons were desirous to have a share in the sacrifice among the gods, and said, &amp;lsquo;Let us share in the sacrifice! Do not exclude us from the sacrifice! Let us have a share in the sacrifice!&amp;rsquo;  02 The gods, however, did not approve of this. The gods not approving, the Seasons went to the Asuras, the malignant, spiteful enemies of the gods.  03 Those (Asuras) then throve in such a manner that they (the gods) heard of it; for even while the foremost (of the Asuras) were still ploughing and sowing, those behind them were already engaged in reaping and threshing: indeed even without tilling the plants ripened forthwith for them.</description>

      <description>01  Thereupon he takes the winnowing basket and the Agnihotra ladle 1, with the text (Vāj. S. I, 6 b): &amp;lsquo;For the work (I take) you, for pervasion (or accomplishment) you two!&amp;rsquo; For the sacrifice is a work: hence, in saying &amp;lsquo;for the work you two,&amp;rsquo; he says, &amp;lsquo;for the sacrifice.&amp;rsquo; And &amp;lsquo;for pervasion you two,&amp;rsquo; he says,  because he, as it were, pervades (goes through, accomplishes) the sacrifice.</description>

      <description>01  He now prepares two strainers (pavitra) 1, with the text (Vāj. S. I, 12 a): &amp;lsquo;Purifiers (or strainers, pavitra) are ye, and belonging to Vishṇu!&amp;rsquo; For Vishṇu is the sacrifice; so that he thereby says, &amp;lsquo;You belong to the sacrifice.&amp;rsquo;  02 Two there are of them: for means of cleansing (pavitra) is this (wind) which here ventilates (pavate); and this, it is true, ventilates as one only; but on entering into man, it becomes a forward and a backward one, and they are these two, to wit, the prāṇa (breathing out) and the udāna (breathing up or in) 2.</description>

      <description>01  He now takes the black antelope skin 1, for completeness of the sacrifice. For once upon a time the sacrifice escaped the gods, and having become a black antelope roamed about. The gods having thereupon found it and stripped it of its skin, they brought it (the skin) away with them.  02 Its white and black hairs represent the R̥c-verses and the Sāman-verses; to wit, the white the Sāman and the black the R̥c; or conversely, the black the Sāman and the white the R̥c.</description>

      <description>01  Now the one (viz. the Āgnīdhra) puts the potsherds on (the Gārhapatya fire); the other (viz. the Adhvaryu) the two mill-stones (on the black antelope skin): these two acts are done simultaneously. The reason why they are done simultaneously (is this):  02 The head of this sacrifice is (represented by) the rice-cake 1: for those potsherds (kapāla), no doubt, are to this (rice-cake) what the skull bones (kapāla) are to the head, and the ground rice is  nothing else than the brain.</description>

I, 21): &amp;lsquo;At the impulse of the divine Savitr̥ I pour thee out, with the arms of the Aśvins, with the hands of Pūshan!&amp;rsquo; The import of this formula is the same (as before, I, 1, 2, 17).  02 He now sits down somewhere inside the altar (vedi) 1.</description>

      <description>01  When Indra hurled the thunderbolt at Vr̥tra, that hurled one became fourfold. Of (three parts of) it the wooden sword (sphya) represents one-third or thereabouts, the sacrificial post one-third or thereabouts, and the chariot one-third or thereabouts. That piece, moreover, with which he struck him, was broken off (śr̥); and on falling down it became an arrow (śara): hence the designation arrow, because it was broken off. And in this way the thunderbolt became fourfold.</description>

      <description>01  The gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Prajāpati, were contending for superiority. Then the gods were worsted, and the Asuras thought: &amp;lsquo;To us alone assuredly belongs this world!  02 They thereupon said: &amp;lsquo;Well then, let us divide this world between us; and having divided it, let us subsist thereon!&amp;rsquo; They accordingly set about dividing it with ox-hides from west to east.  03 The gods then heard of this, and said: &amp;lsquo;The Asuras are actually dividing this earth: come, let us go to where the Asuras are dividing it.</description>

      <description>01  He (the Āgnīdhra) now brushes the spoons 1 (with the grass-ends). The reason why he brushes  the spoons is that the course 2 pursued among the gods is in accordance with that pursued among men. Now, when the serving up of food is at hand among men,&amp;ndash;
02 They rinse the vessels, and having rinsed them, they serve up the food with them: in the same way is treated the sacrifice to the gods, that is to say, the cooked oblations and the prepared altar; and those vessels of theirs, the sacrificial spoons.</description>

      <description>01  Now the sacrifice is the man. The sacrifice is the man for the reason that the man spreads (performs) it; and that in being spread it is made of exactly the same extent as the man 1: this is the reason why the sacrifice is the man.  02 The juhū (spoon) further belongs to that (man-shaped sacrifice), and so does the upabhr̥t; and the dhruvā 2 represents its trunk.</description>

He had three mouths; and because he was thus shaped, his name was Viśvarūpa (&amp;lsquo;All-shape&amp;rsquo;).  02 One of his mouths was Soma-drinking, one spirit-drinking, and one for other kinds of food.

      <description>01  He (the Adhvaryu) drives the calves away (from the cows) with a parṇa branch 1. The reason why he drives the calves away with a parṇa branch is this. When the Gāyatrī flew towards Soma (the moon), a footless archer aiming at her while she was carrying him off, severed one of the feathers (parṇa) either of the Gāyatrī or of king Soma 2; and on falling down it became a parṇa (palāśa) tree; whence its name parṇa.</description>

02 This, assuredly, was a sin in the eyes of the gods. &amp;lsquo;He who acts thus towards his own daughter, our sister, [commits a sin],&amp;rsquo; they thought.  03 The gods then said to this god who rules over the beasts (Rudra) 2, &amp;lsquo;This one, surely, commits a sin who acts thus towards his own daughter, our sister.</description>

      <description>01  Now 1 when (the Adhvaryu) says, &amp;lsquo;The divine Hotr̥s are summoned for the proclamation of success,  the human one is called upon for the song of praise (sūkta-vāka);&amp;rsquo; and when the Hotr̥ thereupon recites, he recites good words only 2: he thereby invokes a blessing on the sacrificer. It is indeed after the sacrifice that he thus invokes a blessing. A twofold reason there is for his invoking the blessing after the sacrifice.</description>

      <description>01  The sacrifice being now complete, he (the Adhvaryu) walks round (the fire) to the south, and pours out a vessel (of water); for thus it is (poured out) towards north: therefore he pours it out after walking round to the south, He who sacrifices, doubtless, sacrifices with a desire that he also may obtain a place in the world of the gods. That sacrifice of his then goes forth towards the world of the gods: after it follows the fee which he gives (to the priests), and holding on to the priests&amp;rsquo; fee (follows) the sacrificer.</description>

      <description>The normal performance of the Agnyādhāna, as that of the full and new-moon offerings, requires two days; the first of which is taken up with preliminary rites, while the second&amp;ndash;that is, the first day of the respective half-moon&amp;ndash;is devoted to the chief ceremonies, beginning with the production of the sacred fire by friction. (See II, 1, 4, 8 seq.)
After the sacrificer has chosen his four officiating priests&amp;ndash;viz. the Brahman, Hotr̥, Adhvaryu, and Āgnīdhra (or Agnīdh)&amp;ndash;he proceeds, together with them, to erect the two sheds or &amp;lsquo;firehouses.</description>

      <description>01  He may set up the two fires 1 under the Kr̥ttikās; for they, the Kr̥ttikās, are doubtless Agni&amp;rsquo;s asterism, so that if he sets up his fires under Agni&amp;rsquo;s asterism, (he will bring about) a correspondence (between his fires and the asterism): for this reason he may set up his fires under the Kr̥ttikās.  02 Moreover, the other lunar asterisms (consist of) one, two, three or four (stars), so that the Kr̥ttikās are the most numerous (of asterisms) 2: hence he thereby obtains an abundance.</description>

      <description>01  The spring, the summer, and the rains, these seasons (represent) the gods; and the autumn, the winter, and the dewy season represent the fathers. That half-moon which increases represents the gods, and that which decreases represents the fathers. The day represents the gods, and the night represents the fathers. And, further, the forenoon represents the gods, and the afternoon the fathers.  02 Those seasons, then, are the gods and the fathers; and whosoever, knowing this, invokes them as the gods and fathers, with his invocation of the gods the gods comply, and with his invocation of the fathers the fathers comply.</description>

      <description>01  On the day preceding his Agnyādheya, he (the sacrificer with his wife) should take his food in the day-time. For the gods know the minds of man: they are, therefore, aware that his Agnyādheya is to take place on the morrow; and all the gods betake themselves to his house and stay (upa-vas) in his house; whence this day is called upavasatha (fast-day) 1.  02 Now, as it would be unbecoming for him to take food before men (who are staying with him as his guests) have eaten; how much more would it be so, if he were to take food before the gods have eaten: let him therefore take his food in the day-time.</description>

      <description>01  Now, in performing that sacrifice, they slay it; and in pressing out the king (Soma), they slay him; and in quieting and immolating the victim, they slay it. The haviryajña they slay with the mortar and pestle, and with the two mill-stones.  02 When slain, that sacrifice was no longer vigorous. By means of dakshiṇās (gifts to the priests) the gods again invigorated it: hence the name dakshiṇā, because thereby they invigorated (dakshay) that  (sacrifice).</description>

      <description>01  The Agnihotra, doubtless, is the Sun. It is because he rose in front (agre) of that offering 1, that the Agnihotra is the Sun.  02 When he offers in the evening after sunset, he does so thinking, &amp;lsquo;I will offer, while he is here, who is this (offering);&amp;rsquo; and when he offers in the morning before sunrise, he does so thinking, &amp;lsquo;I will offer, while he is here, who is this (offering):&amp;rsquo; and for this reason, they say, the Agnihotra is the Sun.</description>

      <description>01  Now when Prajāpati, in creating living beings, created Agni, the latter, as soon as born, sought to burn everything here: and so everybody tried to get out of his way 1. The creatures then existing sought to crush him. Being unable to endure this, he went to man.  02 He said, &amp;lsquo;I cannot endure this: come, let me enter into thee! Having reproduced me, maintain me; and as thou wilt reproduce and maintain me in this world, even so will I reproduce and maintain thee in yonder world!</description>

      <description>01  Once on a time the gods deposited with Agni all their beasts, both domestic and wild; either because they were about to engage in battle or from a desire of free scope, or because they thought that he (Agni) would protect them as the best protector.  02 Now Agni coveted them, and seizing them he entered the night with them. &amp;lsquo;Let us go back thither,&amp;rsquo; said the gods, and betook themselves to where Agni was concealed.</description>

      <description>01  Now it was by means of the Vaiśvadeva that Prajāpati produced living beings. The beings produced by him ate (ghas) Varuṇa&amp;rsquo;s barley corn; for originally the barley belonged to Varuṇa. And from their eating Varuṇa&amp;rsquo;s barley corn the name Varuṇapraghāsāḥ (is derived).  02 Varuṇa seized them; and on being seized by Varuṇa, they became rent all over 1; and they lay and sat them down breathing in and breathing out.</description>

He gains it (the year) in three divisions, he conquers it in three divisions. The year means the whole, and the whole is imperishable (without end): hence his righteousness is indeed imperishable. Moreover, he thereby becomes a Season, and as such goes to the gods; but there is no perishableness in the gods, and hence there is imperishable righteousness for him.</description>

He created living beings 2. The living beings created by him passed away: they are those birds. Now man is the nearest to Prajāpati; and man is two-footed: hence birds are two-footed.  02 Prajāpati thought within himself, &amp;lsquo;Even as formerly I was alone, so also am I now alone.</description>
