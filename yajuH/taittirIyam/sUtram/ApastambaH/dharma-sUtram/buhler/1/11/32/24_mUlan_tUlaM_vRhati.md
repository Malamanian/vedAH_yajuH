24. (The foolish decision) of a person who decides wrongly destroys his ancestors and his future happiness, it harms his children, cattle, and house. 'Oh Dharmaprahrāda, (this deed belongs) not to Kumālana!' thus decided Death, weeping, the question (addressed to him by the Ṛṣi). [^6] 


[^6]:  Haradatta tells the story to which the second half of the verse alludes, in the following manner: 'A certain Ṛṣi had two pupils, called Dharmaprahrāda and Kumālana. Once they brought from the forest two great bundles of firewood and threw them negligently into their teacher's house, without looking. One of the bundles struck the teacher's little son so that he died. Then the teacher asked his two pupils, "Which of you two has killed him?" Both answered, "Not I, not I." Hereupon the teacher, being unable to (come to a decision in order to) send away, the sinner and to keep the innocent one, called Death, and asked him, "Which of the two has killed the boy?" Then Death, finding himself involved in a difficult law-question, began to weep, and p. 99 giving his decision, said, "Oh Dharmaprahrāda, not to Kumālana (the dative has the sense of the genitive), this sin is none of Kumālana's!" Instead of declaring, "Dharmaprahrāda, thou hast done this,' he said, "The other did not do it." Still from the circumstances of the case it appeared that the meaning of the answer was, "The other has done it." "This was the decision which he gave crying."'--The reading of the text rendered in the translation is, dharmaprahrāda na kumālanāya.
