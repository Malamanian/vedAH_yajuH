14. By way of laudation they are called 'great sacrifices ' or 'great sacrificial sessions.' [^10] 


[^10]:  The commentator observes, that, as these rites are called 'great sacrifices,' by way of laudation only, the particular laws binding on performers of real Soma-sacrifices cannot be transferred to the performers of these ceremonies. Regarding the p. 48 term 'great sacrifices,' see also Taitt. Ār. II, 11, 10, 1 seq., and Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa XI, 59 6, 1.
