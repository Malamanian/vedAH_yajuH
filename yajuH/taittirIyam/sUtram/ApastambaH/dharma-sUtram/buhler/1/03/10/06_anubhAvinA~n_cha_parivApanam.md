6. Persons who are younger (than the relation deceased), must shave (their hair and beard), [^4] 


[^4]:  The word anubhāvinah, interpreted by Haradatta as 'persons who are younger than the deceased,' is explained in different ways by others; firstly, as 'the mourners,' and secondly, as 'Samānodakas or gentiles beyond the sixth degree.' In the latter case the Sūtra ought to be-translated thus: 'On the death of gentiles beyond the sixth degree, (the head) ought to be shaved.'
