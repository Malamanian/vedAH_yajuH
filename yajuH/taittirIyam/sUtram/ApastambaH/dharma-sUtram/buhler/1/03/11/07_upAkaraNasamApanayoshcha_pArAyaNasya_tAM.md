Above (I, 3, 9, 1) the yearly -performance of the Upākarma and Utsarga ceremonies for the beginning and end of the Brahmanic term has been prescribed. In this Sūtra the performance of the Upakarma and Utsarga at the beginning and completion of the Pārāyana or the vow to go through a whole Veda is incidentally mentioned. Thence it may be inferred that these ceremonies must. be likewise performed on the latter occasions, though no absolute rule to this effect has been given. Such Jñāpakas are of frequent occurrence in all Sūtras, and constitute one of the chief difficulties of their interpretation.
