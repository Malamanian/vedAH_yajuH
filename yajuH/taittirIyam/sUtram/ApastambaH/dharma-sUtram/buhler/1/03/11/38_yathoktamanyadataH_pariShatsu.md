38. Further particulars (regarding the interruption [^21]  of the Veda-study may be learnt) from the (teaching and works of other) Vedic schools.


[^21]:  Haradatta thinks that by 'Pariṣad,' Manu's and other Dharma-śāstras are meant. This explanation is, however, not exact. Pariṣad, 'assemblage,' means, in the language of the Śāstras, either a Pañc, an assemblage of learned Brahmans called together to decide some knotty point of law, or a Brahminical school, which studies a particular redaction of the Veda (see the Petersburg Dict. s. v.) The latter meaning is that applicable to this Sūtra. By 'Pariṣadaḥ' are here intended the Vedic schools, and their writings and teaching. Gautama also says, XVI, 40. Prātividyaṃ yān smarantismaranti, '(he shall observe the stoppages of the Veda-study) which they teach in (the writings belonging to) each of the Vedas.'
