A similar rule occurs Gautama XVI, 34, Where a Manuṣyayagña is mentioned as a cause for discontinuing the recitation of the Veda. In his Commentary on Gautama, also, Haradatta is in doubt. He first refers the term to the sacraments like the Sīmantonnayana, and then adds, that some explain it to mean 'a sacrifice to gods who formerly were men.'
