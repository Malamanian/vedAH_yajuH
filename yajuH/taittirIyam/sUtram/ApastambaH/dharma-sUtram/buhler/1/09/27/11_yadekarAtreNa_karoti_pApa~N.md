11. A Brāhmaṇa removes the sin which he committed by serving one day and night (a man of) the black race, if he bathes for three years, eating at every fourth meal-time. [^6] 


[^6]:  The expression kṛṣṇa varṇa, 'the black race,' is truly Vedic. In the Ṛj-veda it usually denotes the aboriginal races, and sometimes the demons. Others explain the Sūtra thus: p. 88 A Brāhmaṇa removes the sin, which he committed by cohabiting for one night with a female of the Śūdra caste, &c.--Haradatta. The latter explanation has been adopted by Kullūka on Manu XI. 179.
