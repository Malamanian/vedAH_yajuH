11. He shall not eat in a house where (the host) performs a rite which is not a rite of penance, whilst he ought to perform a penance. [^5] 


[^5]:  If a Brāhmaṇa who has been ordered to perform a penance, performs a Vaiśvadeva or other rite without heeding the order of his spiritual teacher, then a student who has returned home ought not to eat in his house, until the enjoined penance has been performed.'--Haradatta.
