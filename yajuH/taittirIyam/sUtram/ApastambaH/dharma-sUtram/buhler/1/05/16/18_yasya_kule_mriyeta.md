18. He shall not eat in the house of a (relation within six degrees) where a person has died, before the ten days (of impurity) have elapsed. [^8] 


[^8]:  The term "ten days" is used in order to indicate the time of impurity generally. In some cases, as that of a Kṣatriya, this lasts longer. In other cases, where the impurity lasts thirty-six hours only, (the abstention from dining in such houses is shorter.)'--Haradatta. Manu IV, 217.
