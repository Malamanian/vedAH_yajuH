11. Also, when he has crossed a river, he shall purify himself by sipping water. [^7] 


[^7]:  The translation given above is based on the interpretation of Haradatta, who considers that Āpastamba holds 'crossing a river' to cause impurity. The natural and probably the right interpretation, however, is that rejected by Haradatta, 'But he shall sip water after having come out (of the river or tank).'
