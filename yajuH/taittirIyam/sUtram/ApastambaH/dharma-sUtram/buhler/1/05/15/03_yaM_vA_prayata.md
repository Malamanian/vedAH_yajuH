3. Or he, whom a pure person causes to sip water, (becomes also pure). [^3] 


[^3]:  The ceremony of 'sipping water' may be performed in two ways; either the 'person sipping' may take the water out of a river, pond, &c., or he may get the water poured into his hand by another person. But, according to Āpastamba, he must not take a pot or gourd in his left hand and pour the water into his right, as some Smṛtis allow. The reason for this rule is, that Āpastamba considers it essential that both hands should be used in conveying the water to the mouth; see also above, I, 1, 4, 21. This agrees with the custom now followed, which is to bend the right hand into the form of a cow's ear, and to touch the right wrist with the left hand while drinking.
