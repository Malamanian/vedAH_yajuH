38. The staff worn by a Brāhmaṇa should be made of Palāśa wood, that of a Kṣatriya of a branch of the Banian tree, which grows downwards, that of a Vaiśya of Bādara or Udumbara wood. Some declare, without any reference to caste, that the staff of a student should be made of the wood of a tree (that is fit to be used at the sacrifice). [^18]
