17. A student who studies the sacred science shall not dwell with anybody else (than his teacher). [^6] 


[^6]:  The commentator states that this rule refers only to a temporary, not to a professed student (naiṣṭhika). He also gives an entirely different explanation to the Sūtra, which, according to some, means, 'A student who learns the sacred science shall not fast in order to obtain heaven.' This rendering also is admissible, as the word para may mean either a 'stranger' or 'heaven' and upavāsa, 'dwelling' or 'fasting.'
