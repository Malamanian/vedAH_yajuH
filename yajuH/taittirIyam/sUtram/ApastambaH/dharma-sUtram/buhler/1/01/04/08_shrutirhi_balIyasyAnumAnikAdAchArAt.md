8. For (explicit) revealed texts have greater force than custom from which (the existence of a permissive passage of the revelation) may be inferred. [^3] 


[^3]:  'Ānumānika' means "proper to be inferred from." For the existence of a text of the revelation or tradition (Smṛti) is inferred from custom. A visible text of the revelation is (however) of greater weight than a custom from which the existence of a text may be inferred. It is impossible to infer (the existence of a text) which is opposed to such (a visible text), on account of the maxim "an inference (can be made only, if it is) not opposed (by ocular proof)." (Āpastamba), by speaking thus, ("For revealed texts," &c.,) shows that the rule forbidding a student to eat pungent condiments, salt &c. is based on the existing text of a Brāhmaṇa.' --Haradatta.
