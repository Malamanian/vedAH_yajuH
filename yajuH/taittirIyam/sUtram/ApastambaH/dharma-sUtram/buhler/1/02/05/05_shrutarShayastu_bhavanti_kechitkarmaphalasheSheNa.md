5. But some in their new birth, on account of a residue of the merit acquired by their actions (in former lives), become (similar to) Ṛṣis by their knowledge (of the Veda), [^4] 


[^4]:  'How is it then that men in our days, though they transgress the rules prescribed for students, learn the four Vedas with little trouble? (The answer is), By virtue of a residue of the reward (due) for the proper observance of those rules (of studentship) in a former Yuga. Therefore Āpastamba says, Sūtra 6 "But some," &c. New existence means "new birth (life)."'--Haradatta.
