9. If they have begot sons, let them. say to them: 'Go out from amongst us, for thus the Āryas, (throwing the guilt) upon us, will receive you (amongst their number).' [^2] 


[^2]:  It is impossible to agree with Haradatta's explanation of the words to be addressed by Abhiśastas to their children. No Vedic license can excuse the use of the second person plural instead of the third. I propose the following: 'Go out from among us; for thus (leaving the guilt) to us, you will be received (as) Āryas.' it is, however, not improbable that our text is disfigured by several very old corruptions, compare Baudhāyana II, 1, 2, 18.
