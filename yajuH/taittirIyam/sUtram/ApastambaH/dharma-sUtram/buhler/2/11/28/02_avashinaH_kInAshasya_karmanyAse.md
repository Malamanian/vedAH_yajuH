2. A servant in tillage who abandons his work shall be flogged. [^2] 


[^2]:  See Colebrooke, Digest, Book III, Text lxviii, for this Sūtra and the following two. Another commentator, quoted by Haradatta, connects this Sūtra with the preceding, and refers it to a poor lessee of land, who cannot pay the value of the crop which was lost through his negligence. A third explanation refers the Sūtra to a cultivator who neglects to till his land. Jagannātha's authorities, the Cintāmaṇi and Ratnākara, agree with Haradatta's first explanation.
