1. After marriage the rites prescribed for a householder and his wife (must be performed). [^1] 


[^1]:  1. According to Haradatta, this rule is intended to refute the opinion of those who hold that the sacred household-fire may be kept, and the prescribed offerings therein may be performed, either from the time of the marriage, or after the division of the family estate. He also states that the use of the dual gṛhamedhinoḥ indicates that husband and wife must perform the rites conjointly. Manu III, 67.
