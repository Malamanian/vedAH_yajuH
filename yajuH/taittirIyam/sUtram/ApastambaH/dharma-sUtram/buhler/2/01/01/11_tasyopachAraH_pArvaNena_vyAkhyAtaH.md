11. The manner in which that offering must be [^7]  performed has been declared by (the description of the Sthālīpāka) to be performed on the days of the new and full moon (the Pārvaṇa).


[^7]:  The Pārvaṇa Sthālīpāka has been described by Āpastamba p. 101 in the Gṛhya-sūtra, III, 7. Again, Haradatta returns to the question whether the words on that day (Sūtra 7) refer to the Parvan-days, or the marriage-day and its anniversaries. He now adds, in favour of the latter view, that the word Pārvaṇena, 'by the rite to be performed on Parvan-days,' by which the Sthālīpāka on Parvan-days is intended, clearly proves the impossibility to refer he preceding rules to the Parvan-days. He adds that some, nevertheless, adopt the explanation rejected by himself.
