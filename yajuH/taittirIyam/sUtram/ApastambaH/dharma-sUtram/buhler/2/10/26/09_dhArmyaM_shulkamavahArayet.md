9. The (king) shall make them collect the lawful taxes (śulka). [^8] 


[^8]:  According to Haradatta, who quotes Gautama in his commentary, the śulka is the 1/20th part of a merchant's gains. On account of the Sūtras immediately following, it is, however, more probable that the term is here used as a synonym of 'kara,' and includes all taxes. 'Lawful' taxes are, of course, those sanctioned by custom and approved of by the Smṛtis.
