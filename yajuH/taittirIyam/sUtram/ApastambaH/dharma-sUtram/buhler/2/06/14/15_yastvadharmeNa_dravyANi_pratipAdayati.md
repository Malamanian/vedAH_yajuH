15. But him who expends money unrighteously, he shall disinherit, though he be the eldest son. [^13] 


[^13]:  Compare for this Sūtra and the following one Colebrooke's Digest, Book V, Text cccxv. The translation of pratipādayati, 'expends,' by 'gains,' which is also proposed by Jagannātha, is against Āpastamba's usage, see II, 5, 11, 17, and below, II, 8, 20, 19.
