10. He shall live without a fire, without a house, Without pleasures, without protection. Remaining silent and uttering speech only on the occasion of the daily recitation of the Veda, begging so much food only in the village as will sustain his life, he shall wander about neither caring for this world nor for heaven. [^5] 


[^5]:  Manu VI, 33, 42-45; Yājñ. III, 58 seq.
