1. There are four orders, viz. the order of householders, the order of students, the order of ascetics, and the order of hermits in the woods. [^1] 


[^1]:  21. 'Though four (orders) are enumerated, he uses the word "four," lest, in the absence of a distinct rule of the venerable teacher, one order only, that of the householder, should be allowed, as has been taught in other Smṛtis.'--Haradatta. Manu VI, 87.
