12. (If any one should contend that) the term Veda (on account of its etymology, implying that which teaches duty or whereby one obtains spiritual merit) applies to the complete collection of (works which contain) rules for rites to be performed on the authority of precepts, (that, consequently, the Kalpa-sūtras form part of the Veda, and that thereby) the number (fixed above) for those (Aṅgas) is proved to be wrong, [^7] 


[^7]:  This Sūtra and the following one are directed against those who consider the Kalpa-sūtras to be a part of the Veda, the revealed texts. See also Max Müller's History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, p. 95 seq.
