1. He shall avoid butter, butter-milk, oil-cake, honey, meat. [^1] 


[^1]:  18. Sūtras 1-4 contain rules for a vow to be kept for the special objects mentioned in Sūtras 3 and 4 for one year only Haradatta (on Sūtra 4) says that another commentator thinks that Sūtras 1-3 prescribe one vow, and Sūtra 4 another, and that the latter applies both to householders and students. A passage front Baudhāyana is quoted in support of this latter view.
