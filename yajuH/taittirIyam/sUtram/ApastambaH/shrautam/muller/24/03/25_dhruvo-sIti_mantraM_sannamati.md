If there is contradiction with regard to the substance and the preparation of an offering, the substance prevails.

## Commentary

A puroḍāśa may be made of vrīhi, rice, or of nīvāra, wild growing rice. The wild rice has to be pounded, but not the good rice. The preparation, however, has to yield in a vikṛti, the important point being the substance.
