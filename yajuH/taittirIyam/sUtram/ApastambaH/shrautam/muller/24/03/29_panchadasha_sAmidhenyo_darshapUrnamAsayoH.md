If there is sameness both in the offering and in the deity, then the offering prevails.

## Commentary

If a caru for Prajāpati occurs in a vikṛti sacrifice, it would follow that, being offered to Prajāpati, it should be offered with murmuring, but, as it is a vegetable offering, it follows the norm of the puroḍāśa, though the puroḍāśa is intended for Agni.
