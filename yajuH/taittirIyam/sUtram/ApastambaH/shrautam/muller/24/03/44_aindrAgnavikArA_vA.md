Or, doing as he likes in dividing (the butter).

## Commentary

These three Sūtras belong together. They teach that one slice (avadāna) of butter should be taken, melted, and poured on the Āhavanīya fire; or, if there are more than one āhuti, then one slice should be taken for each. This, however, is made optional again by the last Sūtra.
