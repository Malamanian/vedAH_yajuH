## Translation
5. To it we distribute (*kṣad*) ghee, strong drink, honey, food after  
food; for us, as a father for his sons, let it provide (*cikits-*) what  
is better and better, more and more, morrow after morrow—the amulet,  
coming from the gods.

## Notes
Ppp. omits the fifth pāda. By a curious blunder, most of our mss. (all  
save I.O.D.) leave *surām* in **a** unaccented; ⌊and so do four of  
SPP's⌋.
