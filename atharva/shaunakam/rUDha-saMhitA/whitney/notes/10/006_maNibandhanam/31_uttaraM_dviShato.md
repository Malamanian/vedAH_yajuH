## Translation
31. Let this god-born amulet make me superior to my hater; whose  
milked-out milk these three worlds worship, let that amulet mount here  
upon me, in order to supremacy, at the head.

## Notes
That is, probably, 'mount upon my head.' According to Prāt. ii. 65, we  
ought to read *maṇíṣ kṛ-;* ⌊this is the reading of three of SPP's mss.,  
but of none of W's so far as noted: both texts give *maṇíḥ*⌋. The pāda  
*sa mā ’yam adhi rohatu* (31 **e**, 32 **c**) is quoted in the comm. to  
Kāuś. 19. 25. The Anukr. takes no notice of the redundant syllable in  
**a**. Ppp. reads, for **e**, *sa tvā ’yam abhi rakṣatu*.
