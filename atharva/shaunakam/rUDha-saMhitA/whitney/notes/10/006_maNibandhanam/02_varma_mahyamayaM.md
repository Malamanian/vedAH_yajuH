## Translation
2. This amulet, born of the plow-share, shall make defense (*várman*)  
for me; it hath come to me filled with stir-about, with sap, together  
with splendor.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *tṛptas* instead of *púrṇas* in **c**. ⌊Pada **b** is cited  
with vss. 1, 4 **c**, 6 **b** in the schol. to Kāuś. 19. 23.⌋
