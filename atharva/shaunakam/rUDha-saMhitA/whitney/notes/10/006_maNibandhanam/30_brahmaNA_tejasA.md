title = "३० ब्रह्मणा तेजसा"

## Translation
30. Together with *bráhman*, with brightness, I fasten on myself the  
propitious one; free from rivals, rival-slaying, it hath made my rivals  
beneath me.

## Notes
Besides the quotation in Kāuś. 19. 25 (see just above), this verse is  
used in the comm. to Kāuś. 26. 40. *Muñcāsi* in **b** is a misprint for  
*muñcāmi*.
