## Translation
3. There is joined, fourfold (*cátuṣṭaya*), with closed (*sáṁhita-*)  
ends, above the two knees, the pliant (*śithirá*) trunk; what the hips  
are, the thighs—who indeed produced (*jan*) that, by which the body  
(*kúsindha*) became very firm?

## Notes
Ppp. reads *saṁhatantaṁ* in **a**, and *sudhṛtam* in **d**.
