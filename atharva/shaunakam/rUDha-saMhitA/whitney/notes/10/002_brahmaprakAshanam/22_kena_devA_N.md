## Translation
22. Wherewith does he dwell upon (? *anu-kṣi*) the gods? wherewith  
\[upon\] the people of the god-folk? wherewith this other asterism?  
whereby is authority (*kṣatrá*) called real (*sát*)?

## Notes
The sense here is very obscure, and the rendering mechanical. ⌊Griffith  
suggests that the point may lie in using *nakṣatram* as if it were *na  
kṣatram*, 'non-power,' in opposition to *kṣatram* in **d**.⌋ Ppp. has,  
for **b**, *kena devīr ajanayad diśaḥ*. The meter requires in **a**  
*kṣyati*, as the forms are written in some texts. The Anukr. takes no  
notice of the irregularity.
