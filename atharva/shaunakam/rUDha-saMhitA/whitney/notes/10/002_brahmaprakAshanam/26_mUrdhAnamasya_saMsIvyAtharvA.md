## Translation
26. Atharvan, having sewed together his head, and also (*yát*) his  
heart—aloft from the brain the purifying one sent \[them\] forth, out of  
the head.

## Notes
'The purifying one' (*pávamāna*) is soma; it is perhaps identified here  
with Atharvan; but the whole sense is extremely obscure. Ppp. reads at  
the end *śīrṣṇaḥ*.
