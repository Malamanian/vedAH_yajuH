## Translation
6. Who bored out the seven apertures in his head—these ears, the  
nostrils, the eyes, the mouth? in the might of whose conquest (*vijayá*)  
in many places quadrupeds \[and\] bipeds go their way.

## Notes
Bp. reads at the end *yā́man*. Ppp. puts *nāsike* after *cakṣaṇī*, and  
reads in **c** *vijāyasya mahamani*, and at the end *yomūn*. The Anukr.  
does not heed that **d** is a *triṣṭubh* pāda.
