title = "२१ ब्रह्म श्रोत्रियमाप्नोति"

## Translation
21. The *bráhman* obtains one learned in revelation, the *bráhman* this  
most exalted one; the *bráhman* \[as\] man this Agni; the *bráhman*  
measured the year.

## Notes
Here and in vss. 23 and 25 an instrumental is distinctly and strongly  
called for, instead of the nominative *bráhma;* yet to call *bráhma* an  
instr., and translate it as such, does not seem possible. ⌊Cf. Caland,  
KZ. xxxi. 261.⌋ Ppp. reads, for **c, d**, *brahma yajñasya śraddhā ca  
brahmā ’smi ca hataṁ manaḥ*.
