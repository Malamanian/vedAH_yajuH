## Translation
8. Which was that god who \[produced\] his brain, his forehead, his  
hindhead (? *kakā́ṭikā*), who first his skull, who, having gathered a  
gathering in man's jaws, ascended to heaven?

## Notes
D. reads *cityám* in **c**; all the mss. agree in *ruroha*, although  
*ruróha* is obviously required. ⌊Otherwise Henry.⌋ The verse, as noted  
above, is wanting in Ppp.
