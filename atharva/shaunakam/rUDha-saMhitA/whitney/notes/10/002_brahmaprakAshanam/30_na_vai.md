title = "३० न वै"

## Translation
30. Him verily sight doth not desert, nor breath, before old age, who  
knoweth the *bráhman's* stronghold (*púr*), from which man (*púruṣa*) is  
\[so\] called.

## Notes
The latter half-verse is identical with 28 **c, d**. Ppp. reads *puraḥ*  
at end of **b**, and *yasmāt* in **d**.
