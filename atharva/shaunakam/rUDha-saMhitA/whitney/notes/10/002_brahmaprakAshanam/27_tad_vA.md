## Translation
27. Verily that head of Atharvan \[is\] a god-vessel, pressed together;  
breath defends that, the head, food, also mind.

## Notes
For *samubjīta*, as said of a *kośa*, compare ix. 3. 20 above. Ppp.  
reads *prāṇo ‘bhi* in **c**, and *śrīm* for *śiras* in **d**. The three  
nouns in **d** might be nom. instead of accus.
