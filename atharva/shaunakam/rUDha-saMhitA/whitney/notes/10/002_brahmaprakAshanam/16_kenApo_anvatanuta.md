## Translation
16. With what did he stretch the waters along? with what did he make the  
day to shine? with what did he kindle (*anu-idh*) the dawn? with what  
did he give the coming-on of evening?

## Notes
The *pada*-text reads *ā́paḥ* (as in 11 **a**) in **a**. Ppp. elides  
*‘nv* after it. ⌊For *āindha*, cf. *Gram.* §684 c.⌋
