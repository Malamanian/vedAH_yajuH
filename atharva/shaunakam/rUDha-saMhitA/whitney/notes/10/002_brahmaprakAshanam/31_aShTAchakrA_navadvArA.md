## Translation
31. Eight-wheeled, nine-doored, is the impregnable stronghold of the  
gods; in that is a golden vessel, heaven-going (*svargá*), covered with  
light.

## Notes
The verse is found also in TA. (i. 27. 2-3), which reads *hiraṇmayas* in  
**c**, and inserts *lokás* after *svargás* in **d**. ⌊Reminiscences of  
this verse are seen in x. 8. 43 **a, b**.⌋
