title = "२५ क्रोडौ ते"

## Translation
25. Let thy two breasts (*kroḍá*) be sacrificial cakes, smeared over  
with sacrificial butter; having made them wings, O divine one, do thou  
carry him who cooks thee to heaven (*dív*).

## Notes
The Anukr. very strangely ignores the two resolutions in **b** and  
**c**, and reckons the pādas as 7 syllables each.
