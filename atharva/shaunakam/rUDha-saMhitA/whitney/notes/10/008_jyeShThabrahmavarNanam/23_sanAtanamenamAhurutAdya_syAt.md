## Translation
23. Everlasting they call him, also may he be at present ever-renewed;  
day and night are generated (*pra-jā*) in each other's forms.

## Notes
The *pada*-text reads *anyáḥ:* *anyásya* in **d**, although the masc.  
*anyás* shows that the two words are virtually a compound, as later.
