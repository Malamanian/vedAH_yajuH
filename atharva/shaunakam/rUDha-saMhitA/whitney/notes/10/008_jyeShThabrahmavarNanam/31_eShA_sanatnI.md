## Translation
31. The deity, Avi by name, sits enveloped with right; by her form these  
trees \[are\] green, green-garlanded.

## Notes
Or, 'by the form of her, the green-garlanded one' (so Ludwig). *Ávi*  
means 'sheep,' but is possibly here a derivative from the root *av*  
'favor, aid.' All the *saṁhitā*-mss. combine in **a, b** *-ta rténa*.
