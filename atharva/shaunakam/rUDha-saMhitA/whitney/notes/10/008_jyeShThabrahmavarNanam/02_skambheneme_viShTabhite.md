## Translation
2. By the *skambhá* these two stand fixed apart, both sky and earth; in  
the *skambhá* \[is\] all this that has soul, what \[is\] breathing and  
what winking.

## Notes
The Anukr. is scrupulous enough not to sanction the irregular  
combination *skambhé ’dám* in **c**; why it calls the verse  
*bṛhatīgarbhā*, instead of simply *bhurij* (like vs. 5), it were hard to  
say.
