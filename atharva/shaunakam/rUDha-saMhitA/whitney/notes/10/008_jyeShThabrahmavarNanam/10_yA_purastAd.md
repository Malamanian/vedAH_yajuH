## Translation
10. The one which is applied (*yuj*) in front and which behind, which is  
applied in all cases and which in every case, by which the sacrifice is  
extended forward—that I ask of thee: which one of the verses is it?

## Notes
The verse is quoted by pratīka in GB. i. 1. 22. All our *saṁhitā*-mss.  
save one (R.) ⌊and the great majority of SPP's⌋ read at the end *sá  
rcā́m* (Ppp. the same), and the words are quoted under Prāt. iii. 49 as  
example of that combination ⌊p. *sā́ ṛcā́m*⌋. The Anukr. does not heed  
that **b** is a *jagatī* pāda. Ppp. reads twice *yo ’ta* for *yā ca*.
