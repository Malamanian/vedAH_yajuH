title = "२४ शतं सहस्रमयुतं"

## Translation
24. A hundred, a thousand, a myriad, a hundred million, an innumerable  
\[number\], is his own entered into him; that of him they slay, even as  
he looks on; therefore this god shines (*ruc*) thus.

## Notes
Instead of *eṣa etat* at the end, Ppp. reads what appears to be *agha  
bhavat*. The version is as literal (and as unintelligent) as possible.  
The Anukr. takes no notice of the irregularity of the meter; it is  
possible, by violence, to count only 44 syllables in the verse.
