## Translation
35. They by whom the wind sent forth blows on, who give the five  
quarters together (*sadhryàñc*), the gods who thought themselves above  
(*ati-man*) the offering (*ā́huti*), conductors of the waters—which were  
they?

## Notes
The first half-verse is found also in Ppp. ⌊xvi.⌋, but not in connection  
with the rest of the hymn. The Anukr. does not heed that **a** is  
defective by one syllable. Read in **b**, with all ⌊W's and SPP's⌋ mss.,  
*dádante;* the form is from the same secondary root *dad* as the sing.  
*dadate* in 36 **c**. ⌊JUB. (i. 34) has this verse, putting it in the  
mouth of Pṛthu Vāinya, and its answer (vs. 36), with appended  
Brāhmaṇa-comment. It reads *samīcīḥ* for *sadhrīcīḥ* of our 35 **b**,  
and *āhutīs* in **c**.⌋
