## Translation
26. This beautiful one (f.) \[is\] unaging, an immortal in the house of  
a mortal; for whom she \[was\] made, he lies; he who made \[her\] grew  
old.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *tasmāi* for *yasmāi* in **c**. ⌊The natural reading of **b**  
would be *mártyasya amṛ́ta gṛhé*; but⌋ the definition of the Anukr.  
forbids us to make ⌊it. Can a *sā́* have dropped out before *śáye sá?*  
Cf. note to iv. 5. 5.⌋
