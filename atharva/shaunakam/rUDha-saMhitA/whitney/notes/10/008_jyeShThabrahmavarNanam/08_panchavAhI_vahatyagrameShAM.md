## Translation
8. One carrying five carries the summit (*ágra*) of them; side-horses,  
harnessed, carry also along; what is not gone of it was seen, not what  
is gone; the higher thing \[is\] closer, the lower more distant.

## Notes
⌊Or (**c**) 'of him' (*asya*).⌋ The sense is wholly obscure, and the  
version a mechanical one. *Pañcavāhī́* may be either fem. (of *-vāhá:* so  
*śatavāhī́* v. 17. 12) or masc. (of *-vāhín*); Pet. Lexx. say 'mit Fünfen  
bespannt.' Some of the mss. read *pṛ́ṣṭhayas* in **b**, as often in such  
cases. Ppp. has *asya* instead of *eṣām* at end of **a**.
