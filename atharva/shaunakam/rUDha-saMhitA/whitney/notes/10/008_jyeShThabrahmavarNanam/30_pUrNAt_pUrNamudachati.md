title = "३० पूर्णात् पूर्णमुदचति"

## Translation
30. She, everlasting, born indeed of old, she, ancient, encompassed  
(*pari-bhū*) all; the great goddess of the dawn, shining forth, she  
looks forth by every one who winks.

## Notes
The Anukr. calls the verse *bhurij* on account of the redundant syllable  
in **b**, not heeding the corresponding deficiency in **c**.
