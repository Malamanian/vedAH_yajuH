## Translation
11. What stirs, flies, and what stands, and what is breathing, not  
breathing, winking—that, all-formed, sustains the earth; that,  
combining, becomes one only.

## Notes
One may conjecture *apānát* for *áprāṇat* in **b**. The Anukr. does not  
heed that two of the pādas are *triṣṭubh*. Ppp. reads at end of **b**  
*ca tiṣṭhat*, and, in **c**, *dyām utā ’muṁ* ⌊at 7. 35 it was fem.⌋ for  
*viśvarūpam*.
