## Translation
39. As between heaven-and-earth Agni went, burning on, all-consuming,  
where stood beyond they (f.) of one husband—where perchance was  
Mātariśvan then?

## Notes
The *bṛhatī* of the Anukr. ⌊scanning 11 + 9: 11 + 11⌋ the second pāda,  
read with *āit* included as a part (the *pada*-text so marks the  
division)—which is, of course, artificial and wrong. ⌊Read as 12 + 8: 11  
+ 11, pronouncing *-dāvías* and *kúe ’vā ”sīn*.⌋ Ludwig's 'spouses of  
the only one' for *ékapatnīs* is against the accent.
