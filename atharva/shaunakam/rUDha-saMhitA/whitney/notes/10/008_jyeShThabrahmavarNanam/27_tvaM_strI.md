## Translation
27. Thou art woman, thou \[art\] man, thou boy, or also girl; thou, when  
aged, totterest (*vañc*) with a staff; thou, when born, becomest facing  
all ways.

## Notes
Ppp. politely puts *kumārī* first and *kumāras* second in **b**, and  
reads *jātam* in **d**. The verse is found, without variant, in śvet.  
Up. iv. 3. It is so far correctly described by the Anukr. that it counts  
37 syllables (7 + 10: 9 + 11 = 37).
