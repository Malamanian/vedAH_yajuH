## Translation
29. The full from the full he bends up (*ud-ac*); the full is poured  
with the full; also that may we know today, whence that is poured out.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
This verse is akin with ⌊the oft-repeated⌋ one in śB. xiv. 8. 1 (BAU. v.  
1): *pūrṇám adáḥ pūrṇám idám pūrṇā́t pūrṇám úd acyate* etc. What follows  
of the hymn is (as noted above) wanting in Ppp.
