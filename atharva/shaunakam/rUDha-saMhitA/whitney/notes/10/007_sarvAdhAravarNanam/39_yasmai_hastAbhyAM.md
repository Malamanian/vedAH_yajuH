title = "३९ यस्मै हस्ताभ्यां"

## Translation
39. Unto which with the two hands, with the two feet, with speech, with  
hearing, with sight; unto which the gods continually render (*pra-yam*)  
tribute, unmeasured in the measured out—that *skambhá* tell \[me\]:  
which forsooth is he?

## Notes
Notwithstanding the discordance of case, *vímite* is perhaps coordinate  
with *yásmāi*. Ppp. omits the first two pādas. The dual and the  
repetition of *yásmāi* make it probable that we have to supply in them  
'one renders tribute,' or the like. The Anukr. takes no notice of the  
redundant syllable in **d**.
