## Translation
10. Where men know both worlds and receptacles (*kóśa*), waters,  
*bráhman*, within which \[are\] both the non-existent and the  
existent—that Skambha tell \[me\]: which forsooth is he?

## Notes
A part of this verse has disappeared in Ppp. ⌊The *pada* reads *ā́paḥ*  
and *antáḥ*.\]
