title = "३१ नाम नाम्ना"

## Translation
31. Name with name he calls aloud, before the sun, before the dawn; as  
first the goat (? *ajá*) came into being, he went unto that autocracy  
beyond which there is nothing else existent.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *johavīmi* in **a**, and *jagāma* (for *iyāya*) in **d**. The  
translators all understand *ajás* here as 'the unborn one,' and with  
more reason than in most places elsewhere. The description given by the  
Anukr. of the very irregular verse (8 + 8: 10 + 10 + 11 = 47) is  
altogether ill-fitting.
