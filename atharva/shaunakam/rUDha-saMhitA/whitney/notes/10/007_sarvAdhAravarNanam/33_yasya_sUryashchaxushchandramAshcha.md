## Translation
33. Of whom the sun is eye, and the moon that grows new again; who made  
Agni his mouth—to that chief *bráhman* be homage.

## Notes
Ppp. combines *cakrā ”syaṁ* in **c**. As to the meter, see the note to  
vs. 32. ⌊The Anukr. seems to mean that this is an *anuṣṭubh* of which  
the last pāda is one of 10 syllables (*virāj*).⌋
