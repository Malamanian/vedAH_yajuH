## Translation
6. Whither desiring to attain run in concord the two maidens (*yuvatí*)  
of diverse form, day-and-night? whither desiring to attain, the waters  
go, that Skambha tell \[me\]: which forsooth is he?

## Notes
Here it is only the last pāda that is one syllable in excess. Ppp. puts  
the verse before our 5.
