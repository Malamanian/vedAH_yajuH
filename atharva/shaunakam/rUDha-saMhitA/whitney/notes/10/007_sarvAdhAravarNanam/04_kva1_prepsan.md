## Translation
4. Whither desiring to attain does Agni flame aloft? whither desiring to  
attain blows Mātariśvan? whither desiring to attain, the turns (*āvṛ́t*)  
go, that Skambha tell \[me\]: which forsooth is he?

## Notes
Here we have two syllables in excess, unnoticed by the Anukr. Many of  
the mss. accent *svít* in **d**.
