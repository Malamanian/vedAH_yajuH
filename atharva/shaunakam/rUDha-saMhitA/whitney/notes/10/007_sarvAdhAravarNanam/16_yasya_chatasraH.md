## Translation
16. Of whom the four directions are (*sthā*) the teeming (? *prapyasá*)  
veins, where the sacrifice hath strode forth, that Skambha etc. etc.

## Notes
*Prathamā́s* at end of **b** in our edition seems to be a misprint for  
*prathasā́s*, intended as a correction of *prapyasā́s*, which last,  
however, is distinctly read by all our mss.\* (p. *pra॰pyasā́ḥ*); for the  
formation, compare *-bhyasa* from root *bhī* (through a secondary root  
*bhyas*). \*⌊Except P., which has *prathasā́s;* SPP. puts *-mā́s* into his  
text against his fifteen authorities, which give *prapyasā́s*.
