title = "४१ यो वेतसं"

## Translation
41. He who knows the golden reed (*vetasá*) standing in the sea—he  
verily is in secret Prajāpati.

## Notes
All the mss. have in **c** *gúhya pr-;* perhaps *gúhā* was the original  
reading; our text has emended to *gúhyaḥ*.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
The remaining verses are wanting in Ppp.; they appear to constitute no  
original part of the hymn. They are also not translated by Muir and  
Scherman.
