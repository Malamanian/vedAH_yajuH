## Translation
15. Where both immortality (*amṛ́ta*) and death are set together in man  
(*púruṣa*), of whom the ocean, the veins (*nāḍī́*) are set together in  
man, that Skambha etc. etc.

## Notes
Ppp. reads, for **b**, *puruṣaś ca samāhitāḥ*, and puts the verse after  
our 16. Read in **a** *mṛtyúś ca* (an accent-sign slipped out of place).
