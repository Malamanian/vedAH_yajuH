title = "११ यत्र तपः"

## Translation
11. Where penance, striding forth, maintains the higher vow (*vratá*),  
where both right and faith, waters, *bráhman*, are set together, that  
Skambha etc. etc.

## Notes
The verse (8 + 8: 8 + 8 + 12 = 44) is, with those that agree with it,  
strangely named by the Anukr. ⌊Ppp. exchanges the places of *vratam* and  
*ṛtam* in **b, c**, and of *āpas* and *brahma* in **d**.⌋
