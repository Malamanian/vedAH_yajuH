title = "४२ ब्राह्मणाँ अभ्यावर्ते"

## Translation
42. Whom we hunt, him will we lay low with deadly weapons; by our spell  
(*bráhman*) have we made him fall (*pad*) into the opened mouth of the  
most exalted one.

## Notes
Only the latter half-verse is found in Ppp. ⌊namely, in i.⌋. The  
*pada*-text in **d** reads *bráhmaṇā: ā́: apīp-*. The quotation of the  
verse, with vss. 15-21, 50, in Kāuś. was noted above, ⌊see introd.⌋.
