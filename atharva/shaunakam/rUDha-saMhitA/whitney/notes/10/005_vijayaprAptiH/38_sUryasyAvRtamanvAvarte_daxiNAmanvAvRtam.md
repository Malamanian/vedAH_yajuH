title = "३८ सूर्यस्यावृतमन्वावर्ते दक्षिणामन्वावृतम्"

## Translation
38. I turn toward the quarters full of light; let them yield me  
property, let them etc. etc.

## Notes
The metrical description of the Anukr. does not fit the verse (11: 8 +  
8) quite accurately. The resolution *abhi-ā́v-* is implied in all these  
verses.
