## Translation
15. What of you, O waters, is the portion of waters within the waters,  
of the nature of sacrificial formula, sacrificing to the gods, that now  
I let go; that let me not wash down against myself; that do we let go  
against him who hates us, whom we hate; him may I slay (*vadh*), him may  
I lay low, with this spell (*bráhman*), with this act, with this weapon  
(*mení*).

## Notes
⌊Render **c**: 'therewith (i.e. *apām bhāgena* = *udavajreṇa*) do we let  
fly against (*abhyati-sṛj*) him *or* do we shoot against him who' etc.;  
i.e. *ati-sṛj* is used intransitively and "him" is governed by the  
*abhi-*.⌋ ⌊Pādas **b, c** are repeated below as xvi. 1. 4, 5.⌋ At the  
beginning of **c** read *téna* (accent-sign slipped out of place).
