## Translation
21. What of you, O waters, are the fires of the waters within the  
waters, of the nature of sacrificial formula, sacrificing to the gods,  
them now I let go; them let me not wash down against myself; them we let  
go against him who hates us, etc. etc.

## Notes
⌊For **c**: 'with them do we let fly against him who' etc., as in vs.  
15.⌋ In vss. 17-21, after *apām*, Ppp. reads *bindur, vego, vatso, gāvo,  
garbho* respectively. For the quotations in Kāuś. of the common  
*pratīka* of vss. 15-21, together with those of vss. 42 and 50, ⌊see the  
introduction⌋. In all the verses it is possible only by violence to make  
out the structure called for by the Anukramaṇī. ⌊Delete the accent-mark  
over *agnáyo*.⌋
