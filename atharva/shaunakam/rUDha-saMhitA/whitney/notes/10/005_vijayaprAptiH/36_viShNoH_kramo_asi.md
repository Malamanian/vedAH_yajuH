## Translation
36. Ours \[is\] what is conquered, ours what has shot up; I have  
withstood (*abhi-sthā*) all fighters, niggards; now do I involve  
(*ni-veṣṭ*) the splendor, brightness, breath, life-time of him of  
such-and-such lineage, son of such-and-such mother; now do I make him  
fall (*pad*) downward.

## Notes
⌊As to the place of this vs. in the general divisions of the hymn and  
its possible ascription to Mārīca, see the introd. and the Anukr.  
excerpts above.⌋ With this vs. compare xvi. 8. 1; ⌊also the *mantra*  
cited at Kāuś. 47. 22⌋. The vs. reads naturally as 62 syllables (11 +  
11: 15 + 13 + 12 = 62), but can be brought by forced resolutions up to a  
full *aṣṭi* (64 syll.). *Abhy aṣṭhām* is by Prāt. ii. 92.
