title = "०९ यदादित्यैर्हूयमानोपातिष्ठ ऋतवरि"

## Translation
9. When, called by the Ādityas, thou didst approach, O righteous one,  
Indra made thee drink a thousand vessels (*pā́tra*) of soma, O cow.

## Notes
By a notable inconsistency, the Anukr. reckons this verse as a complete  
*anuṣṭubh*, although it requires, to make it such, precisely the same  
resolution (*pā́-tṛ-ān*) as vs. 8.
