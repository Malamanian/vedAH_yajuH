title = "२६ वशामेवामृतमाहुर्वशां मृत्युमुपासते"

## Translation
26. The cow they call immortality (*amṛ́ta*); the cow they worship  
(*upa-ās*) as death; the cow became this all—gods, men, Asuras, Fathers,  
seers.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *āhur amṛtaṁ* in **a**. The definition of the meter by the  
Anukr. is bad; it ⌊seems to be 8 + 8: 8 + 14⌋.
