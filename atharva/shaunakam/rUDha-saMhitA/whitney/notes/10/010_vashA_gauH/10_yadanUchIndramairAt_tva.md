## Translation
10. When thou didst go following (*anváñc*) Indra, then the bull called  
thee; therefore the Vṛitra-slayer, angry, took thy milk (*páyas*), milk  
(*kṣīrá*), O cow.

## Notes
All the *saṁhitā*-mss. accent in **b** *-bhó ‘hvayat*, and one.  
*pada*-ms. (D.) has accordingly *áhvayat*. In like manner, all save  
R.p.m. have *kruddhó ‘har-* in **d**. In both cases our edition emends  
to *ò*. In this verse also (as in 6, 8) the designation *virāj* is  
uncalled-for. Ppp. reads *uvūcī* in **a**, and *ād vṛṣabho* in **b**.
