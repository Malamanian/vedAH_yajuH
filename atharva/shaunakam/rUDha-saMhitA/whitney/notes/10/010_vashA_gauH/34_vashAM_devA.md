## Translation
34. On the cow the gods subsist; on the cow, men also; the cow became  
this all, so far as the sun looks abroad.

## Notes
The Anukr. takes no notice of the redundant syllable in **a** (read, by  
irregular combination, *devó ’pa*).  
  
⌊Here ends the fifth *anuvāka*, with 2 hymns and 61 verses. The quoted  
Anukr. says, referring to this last hymn, *catasraḥ* (i.e. 4 over 30).⌋  
  
⌊One ms. (P.) sums up the verses aright as 350.⌋  
  
⌊Here ends the twenty-third *prapāṭhaka*.⌋
