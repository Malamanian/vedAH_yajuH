## Translation
6. Having the sacrifice for feet, cheer (*írā-*) for milk, *svadhā́* for  
breath, being *mahī́lukā*, the cow, having Parjanya for spouse, goes unto  
the gods with worship (*bráhman*).

## Notes
Ppp. reads for **a, b** *yajñapatir ākṣīrāt svadhāprāṇā mahilokāḥ*,  
which does not solve the problem of the obscure word *mahī́lukā* (found  
nowhere else). There is no need of calling the verse *virāj*.
