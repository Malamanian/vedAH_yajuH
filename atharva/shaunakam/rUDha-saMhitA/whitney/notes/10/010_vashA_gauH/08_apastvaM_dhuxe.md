## Translation
8. The waters thou yieldest (*duh*) first, the cultivated fields after,  
O cow; thou yieldest kingdom third, food, milk, O cow.

## Notes
The permissible resolution *rāṣ-ṭṛ-ám* in **c** would obviate the  
necessity of reckoning the verse as *virāj*. Ppp. combines in **b**  
*urvarā ’parā*.
