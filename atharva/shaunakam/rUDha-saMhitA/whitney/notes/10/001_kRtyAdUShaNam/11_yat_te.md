## Translation
11. In that they have taken (*grah*) the name of thee giving to the  
Fathers, or at the sacrifice—let these plants free thee from all ill  
that is designed (? *saṁdeśyà*).

## Notes
It might be also (in **a, b**) 'those giving to the Fathers have taken  
the name of thee' (Ludwig, 'thy Fathers'). *Saṁdeśyà* is very obscure.  
The first half-verse is wholly corrupt in Ppp.
