## Translation
21. Thy neck-bones (*grīvā́*), O witchcraft, and thy (two) feet I will  
cut up; run thou out; let Indra-and-Agni defend us, they who are of  
progeny rich in progeny.

## Notes
*Prajā́vatī* at the end looks like a corruption of *prajā́patī*, which  
Ppp. reads ⌊R's collation has *prajapatī*⌋. Ppp. also has in **c** *enāṁ  
vṛścatā*. But Kāuś., which quotes the last half-verse in full in 5. 2,  
reads *prajāvatī*. The same half-verse appears also by *pratīka* in  
Vāit. 8. 6 (unless Vāit. takes it rather from Kāuś.).
