## Translation
19. We have found out (*anu-vid*) the hostile sneaking magic (?  
*kártra*) that was applied, perceived (? *anu-budh*), buried: let that  
go whence it was brought; there let it roll about like a horse; let it  
slay the progeny of the witchcraft -maker.

## Notes
Ppp. reads in **c** *āgatam* for *ābhṛtam*, and combines in **d** *aśve  
’va*, as called for by the meter. The Anukr. is as bad in its treatment  
of this verse as of 15.
