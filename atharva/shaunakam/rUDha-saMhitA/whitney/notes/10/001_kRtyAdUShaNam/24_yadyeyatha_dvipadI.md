title = "२४ यद्येयथ द्विपदी"

## Translation
24. If thou camest \[as\] biped, as quadruped, put together by the  
witchcraft-maker, all-formed, do thou, becoming octoped, go away again  
from here, O misfortune!

## Notes
The verse has the same structure as 20. The *pada*-text here and in vs.  
28 reads *ā॰iyátha*.
