## Translation
16. Offward is light for thee, hitherward is no road for thee; make thy  
goings elsewhere than \[toward\] us; go thou by a distant \[road\]  
beyond ninety difficult navigable streams; do not wound thyself; go  
away.

## Notes
One would like to emend *kṣaṇiṣṭhās* in **d**, perhaps to *kṣamiṣṭhās*  
'be patient' i.e. 'linger'; Ppp. has instead *ghāniṣṭhās*, which  
unfortunately gives no help. Ppp. also combines *nāvyā ’ti* in **c**;  
and the description of the Anukr. appears to sanction it.
