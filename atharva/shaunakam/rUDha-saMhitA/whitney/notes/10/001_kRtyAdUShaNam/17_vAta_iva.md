## Translation
17. As the wind the trees, do thou crush (*mṛ*) down, cause to fall; do  
not leave of them cow, horse, man; turning back, O witchcraft, from here  
to thy makers, awaken them unto childlessness.

## Notes
Here, in **c**, even a majority of the mss. (W.I.O.D.T.K.) read  
*kartrén*. Ppp. combines at the beginning *vāte ’va*, as the meter  
demands, and as the Anukr. assumes; *úchiṣāi ’ṣām* is doubtless also the  
real reading in **b**.
