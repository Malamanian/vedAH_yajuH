## Translation
23. Let Bhava-and-śarva hurl (*as*) at the evil-doer, the  
witchcraft-maker, the ill-doer, the missile of the gods, the lightning.

## Notes
Ppp. reads in **a** *pāpakṛtvane* ⌊which is metrically much better⌋. The  
definition of the verse by the Anukr. is very stupid; it is plainly two  
*triṣṭubh* pādas, with an intruded word of three syllables (either  
*duṣkṛ́te* or *vidyútam;* either could be spared). The mss. insert a  
cesura-mark after *kṛtyākṛ́te*.
