## Translation
5. Let evil be to the evil-doer, a curse to the curser; backward we send  
\[her\] forth back, that she may slay the witchcraft-maker.

## Notes
Ppp. reads for **a** *kṛtyās santu kṛtyākṛte*, and, for **c, d**  
*pratyak pratipravartaya yaś cakāra turn ṛcchatu*. To read in our **c**  
*hiṇmasi* (as Ppp. in vs. 2 **c**) would rectify the meter, of whose  
irregularity the Anukr. takes no notice. The *pada*-reading  
*prati॰prahiṇmaḥ* is by Prāt. iv. 95; the word is quoted there in the  
comment as example.
