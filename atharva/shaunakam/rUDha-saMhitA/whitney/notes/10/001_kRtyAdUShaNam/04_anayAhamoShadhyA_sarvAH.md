title = "०४ अनयाहमोषध्या सर्वाः"

## Translation
4. With this herb have I spoiled all witchcrafts—what one they have made  
in the field, what in the kine, or what in thy men.

## Notes
This is a repetition of iv. 18. 5, above. The Anukr. here, as there,  
takes no notice of the defective last pāda.
