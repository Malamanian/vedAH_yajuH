## Translation
23. Whichever of the snakes \[are\] fire-born, herb-born, whichever came  
hither (*ā-bhū*) \[as\] water-born lightnings; those of which the kinds  
are variously great—to those serpents would we pay worship with  
reverence.

## Notes
Ppp. reads, for **b** etc., *ye abhrajā vidyutā ”babhūvuḥ: tāsāṁ jātāni  
bahudhā bahūni tebhyaḥ sarvebhyo* etc.
