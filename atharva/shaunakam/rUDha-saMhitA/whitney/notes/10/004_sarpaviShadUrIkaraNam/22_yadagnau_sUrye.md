## Translation
22. What poison is in fire, in the sun, what in the earth, in herbs,  
*kāndā*-poison, *kanáknaka*—let thy poison come out; let it come.

## Notes
Ppp. has *karikradam* ⌊cf. vs. 13⌋ instead of *kanaknakam*, and at the  
end *vahī* ⌊intending *ahe?*⌋ instead of *viṣam;* and it puts next our  
vs. 25.
