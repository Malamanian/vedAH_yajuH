## Translation
21. I choose as it were the filaments of herbs successfully; I conduct  
as it were mares; O snake, let thy poison come out.

## Notes
Apparently processes analogous to that of extracting the poison are  
referred to. The *pada*-division *sādhu॰yā́* is prescribed by Prāt. iv.  
30. There seems to be no reason why the Anukr. should call the verse  
*kakummatī*.
