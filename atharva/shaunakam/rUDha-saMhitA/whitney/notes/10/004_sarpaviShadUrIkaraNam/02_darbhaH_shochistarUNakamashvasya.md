## Translation
2. *Darbhá*-grass, brightness, young shoot (? *tarū́ṇaka*); horse's  
tail-tuft, rough-one's tail-tuft; chariot's seat (? *bándhura*).

## Notes
The translation, of course, is only mechanical. ⌊Henry, *Mém. de la Soc.  
de Ling.*, ix. 238, corrects an error of his version.⌋ We should have  
expected the Anukr. at least to add *bhurij* to its definition of the  
verse as a *gāyatrī* (8 + 11: 6 = 25). O. (and E. in margin) read  
*puruṣasya* in **b**.
