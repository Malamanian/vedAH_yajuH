## Translation
10. This is the remedy of both, of the ill-horse (*aghāśvá*) and of the  
constrictor; the mischievous (*aghāy-*) snake hath Indra, the snake hath  
Pāidva put in my power (*randhay-*).

## Notes
The Anukr. takes no notice of any deficiency in **b**; it can only be  
supplied by the violent resolution *su-dj-*. Ppp. rectifies the meter by  
the better reading *vṛścikasya ca* ⌊cf. our 15 **c, d**, below⌋.
