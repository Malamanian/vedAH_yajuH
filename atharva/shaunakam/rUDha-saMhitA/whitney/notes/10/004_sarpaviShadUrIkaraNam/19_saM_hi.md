title = "१९ सं हि"

## Translation
19. Since I have grasped together their heads, as a fisherman the  
*kárvara;* having gone away to the middle of the river, I have washed  
out the snake's poison.

## Notes
The mss. do not in general distinguish *ṣṭ* and *ṣṭh*, and *pāuñjiṣṭa*  
would be equally correct here. Ppp. reads *pāuñjiṣṭhī ’va*.
