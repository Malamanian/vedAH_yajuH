## Translation
6. If, having slept, thou shalt see an evil dream; if a wild beast  
(*mṛgá*) shall run a disagreeable course—from overmuch (? pari-)  
sneezing, from the evil utterance of a bird (*śakúni*), this amulet, the  
*varaṇá*, shall shield thee.

## Notes
The translation implies in **b** emendation of *yáti* to *yádi*, which  
seems unavoidable. Ppp., however, appears to have *yati;* it reads  
further in **b** *mṛgaśrutaṁ* and *ajuṣṭaṁ*, in **c** *paricchavā*, ⌊and  
in **d** *vārayātāi*⌋. The verse is included in the *duḥsvapnanāśana  
gaṇa:* see note to Kāuś. 46. 9.
