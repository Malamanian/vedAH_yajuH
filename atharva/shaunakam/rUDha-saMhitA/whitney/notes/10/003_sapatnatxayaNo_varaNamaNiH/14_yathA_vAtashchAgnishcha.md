title = "१४ यथा वातश्चाग्निश्च"

## Translation
14. As both wind and fire devour (*psā*) the trees, the forest-trees, so  
do thou devour my rivals, those born etc. etc.

## Notes
Ppp. again relieves the redundancy of expression by reading *sarvān*  
instead of *vṛkṣān* in **b**; also it has in **c** *-tnāṅs tvam* for  
*-tnān me*.
