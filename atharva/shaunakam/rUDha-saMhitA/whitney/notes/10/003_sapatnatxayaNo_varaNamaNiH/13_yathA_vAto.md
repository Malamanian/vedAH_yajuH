## Translation
13. As the wind breaks with force the trees, the forest-trees, so do  
thou break my rivals, those born before and after; let the *varaṇá*  
defend thee.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *jīrṇān* for *vṛkṣān* in **b**; and, in **c**, *-tnāṅs tvaṁ  
bhan̄dhi*. ⌊With **d**, cf. the Ppp. vs. cited under iii. 6. 2.⌋
