## Translation
17. As the sun shines exceedingly, as in it brilliancy is set, so let  
the *varaṇá* amulet fix (*ni-yam*) in me fame \[and\] growth; let it  
sprinkle me with brilliancy; let it anoint me with glory.

## Notes
Part of the mss. (P.M.D.) accent *asmín* in **b**. Ppp. reads, for **c**  
etc., *evā sapatnāṅs tvaṁ sarvān ati bhāhi syaśvo varuṇas tvā ’bhi  
rakṣatu*. ⌊Either Mr. Whitney took *me* as locative (*Gram.* §492 a); or  
else his 'in me' is an inadvertence for 'for me.'⌋
