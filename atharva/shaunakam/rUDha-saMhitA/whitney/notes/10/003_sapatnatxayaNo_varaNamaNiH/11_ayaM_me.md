title = "११ अयं मे"

## Translation
11. This *varaṇá* on my breast, king, divine forest-tree—let it drive  
(*bādh*) away my foes, as Indra the barbarians, the Asuras.

## Notes
The verse is quoted in the schol. to Kāuś. 10. 2. Ppp. combines *varuṇo  
’rasi*, as the meter requires, but as the Anukr. takes pains not to  
authorize. Ppp. also exchanges the second halves of vss. 11 and 12.
