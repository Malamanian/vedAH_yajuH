title = "१५ यथा वातेन"

## Translation
15. As, destroyed by the wind, the trees lie prostrate (*nyàrpita*), so  
do thou destroy, prostrate my rivals, those born etc. etc.

## Notes
Ppp. is quite corrupt in this verse, but does not appear to offer any  
variant. *Prá kṣiṇīhi* properly ought to be divided in our text.
