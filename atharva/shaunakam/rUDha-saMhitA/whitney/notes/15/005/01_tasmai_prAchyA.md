## Translation
1. ⌊1.⌋ For him, from the intermediate direction of the eastern quarter,  
they made the archer (*iṣvāsá*) Bhava attendant. ⌊2.⌋ The archer Bhava  
attends him \[as\] attendant from the intermediate direction of the  
eastern quarter; not śarva, not Bhava, not Īśāna ('the lord') ⌊3.⌋  
injures him nor his cattle nor his fellows who knoweth thus.

## Notes
A resolution is needed in **a** to make 24 syllables (10 + 6 + 8), also  
in **b** to make the meter *bhurij*. ⌊This paragraph is reckoned to the  
*rāudra gaṇa;* see note to Kāuś. 50. 13.⌋ ⌊The word "him" after  
"injures" is part of the second *avasāna*.⌋
