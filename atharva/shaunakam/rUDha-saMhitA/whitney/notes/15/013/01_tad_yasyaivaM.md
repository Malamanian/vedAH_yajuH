## Translation
1. ⌊1.⌋ Now in whosesoever house a thus-knowing Vrātya abides one night  
as guest, ⌊2.⌋ he thereby gains possession of those pure (*púṇya*)  
worlds that are on the earth.

## Notes
Here again, and in the following verses through 4, the Anukr. fails to  
make any account of the first four words, *tád yásyāi ’váṁ vidvā́n*,  
omitted by the mss. on account of repetition (see note to 11. 1); they  
are restored in our text.
