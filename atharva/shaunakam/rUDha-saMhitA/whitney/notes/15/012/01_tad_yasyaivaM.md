## Translation
1. Now then, to whosesoever houses a thus-knowing Vrātya may come as  
guest when the fires are taken up and the fire-offering (*agnihotrá*)

## Notes
Not one of the mss. writes the first four words of the verse, they being  
viewed as repeated from 10. 1; and here also (compare note to 11. 1) the  
Anukr. reckons them as not belonging to the verse. Bp.O.Kp. write  
*údhṛteṣu* (the compound being inseparable by Prāt. iv. 62). Bp. further  
has *ádhi॰śṛte*.
