## Translation
3. That became one; that became star-marked (*lalā́ma*); that became  
great; that became chief; that became *bráhman;* that became fervor;  
that became truth; therewith he had progeny.

## Notes
Ppp. has the same text with slight differences of order. The verse  
counts the required 48 syllables if we restore the elided *a* in *tápo  
abhavat*.
