## Translation
3. ⌊7.⌋ For him, from the western quarter, ⌊8.⌋ they made the two rainy  
months guardians, and *vāirūpá* and *vāirājá* attendants. ⌊9.⌋ The two  
rainy months guard from the western quarter, and *vāirūpá* and *vāirājá*  
attend, him who knoweth thus.

## Notes
The Anukr. implies in **a** *pratī́ci-ās*. For **c**, the definition  
*bhāumārcī* ⌊so the Berlin ms. and SPP's excerpts in his Critical  
Notice, p. 22⁴⌋ is elsewhere unknown, and appears to be equivalent to  
simple *ārcī*.
