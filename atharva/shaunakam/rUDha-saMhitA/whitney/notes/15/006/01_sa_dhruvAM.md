title = "०१ स ध्रुवां"

## Translation
1. ⌊1.⌋ He moved out toward the fixed quarter; ⌊2.⌋ after him moved out  
both earth and fire and herbs and forest trees and they of forest trees  
and plants. ⌊3.⌋ Verily both of earth and of fire and of herbs and of  
forest trees and of them of forest trees and of plants doth he become  
the dear abode who knoweth thus.

## Notes
To make the metrical descriptions fit closely the subdivisions, we need  
to read *ví-acal-* in **a** and **b**, and *só ag-* in **c**: and so  
more or less throughout the hymn.
