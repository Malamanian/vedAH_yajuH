title = "१० विराजान्नाद्यान्नमत्ति य"

## Translation
10. ⌊19.⌋ As he moved out toward the gods, Īśāna ('the lord'), coming  
into being, moved out after, making fury \[his\] food-eater; ⌊20.⌋ with  
fury as food-eater doth he eat food who knoweth thus.

## Notes
If nāgī gayatrī means 9 + 9 + 6 (Colebrooke, *Miscellaneous Essays*, ii.  
136, as cited by BR.), the first subdivision here comes so near it as to  
be capable of being read as 9 + 9 + 7 (being *bhurij*).
