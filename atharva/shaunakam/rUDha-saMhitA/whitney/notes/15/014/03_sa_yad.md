## Translation
3. ⌊5.⌋ As he moved out toward the western quarter, king Varuṇa, coming  
into being, moved out after, making the waters \[his\] food-eaters; ⌊6.⌋  
with the waters as food-eaters doth he eat food who knoweth thus.

## Notes
Most of the mss. accent *apó ‘nnādī́ḥ* (but Bs. has *-ò*). One or two  
(I.K.) combine *-dī́ṣ kṛtvā́*.
