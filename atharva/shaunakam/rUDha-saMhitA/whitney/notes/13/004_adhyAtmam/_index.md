## Comment
⌊Partly prose, and vss. 14-15, 22-26, and 46-56 are so designated in W's Index, p. 6.⌋ This hymn is not found in Pāipp., nor noticed either in Kāuś. or in Vāit. *⌊Here, indeed (but cf. introd. to hymn 3), the general definition for the whole kāṇḍa as "trāiṣṭubham" does not seem to apply.⌋
