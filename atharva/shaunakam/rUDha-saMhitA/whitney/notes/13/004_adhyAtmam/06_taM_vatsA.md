## Translation
6. On him wait (*upa-sthā*) young ones (*vatsá*), ten, united, having  
one head.

## Notes
Henry acutely suggests emendation in **b** to *-ṇo ‘yútā dáśa* 'ten  
myriads'—i.e. of rays, all heading in the sun itself. It seems probable  
that the original text had *ékaśīrṣās:* cf. *dáśaśīrṣas*, iv. 6. 1; the  
verse as it stands is redundant.
