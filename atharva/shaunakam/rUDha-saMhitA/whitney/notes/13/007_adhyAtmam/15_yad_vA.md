## Translation
43. Either when thou makest the herbs, or when thou rainest excellently,  
or when thou hast increased him of the people (? *janyá*).

## Notes
This appears to be the only example known of the accent *janyá* instead  
of *jánya*, and how little authoritative it is may be inferred from the  
fact that all our mss. leave *avīvṛdhas* unaccented after it. Our text  
makes the necessary emendation to *áv-*. ⌊All SPP's authorities,  
however, agree in reading not only *janyám* but also *avīvṛdhas*. The  
latter he also emends to *áv-*.⌋
