## Translation
37. He verily was born of the waters; of him the waters were born.

## Notes
The metrical description is the same as that of vs. 34, and with the  
same lack of good reason (the mss. read *sa vā adbhya ṛgbhyaḥ  
sāmnyuṣṇiganuṣṭubhāu*, which is senseless, and should doubtless be  
emended to *-uṣṇihāu*).
