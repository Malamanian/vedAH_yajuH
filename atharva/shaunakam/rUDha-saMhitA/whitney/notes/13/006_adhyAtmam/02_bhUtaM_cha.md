## Translation
23. And what is and what shall be and faith and sheen and heaven  
(*svargá*) and *svadhā́*.

## Notes
The mss. vary between *bhavyàm* (Bp.), *bhávyam* (Bs.p.m.D.), and  
*bhavyám* (Bs.s.m., and all the rest). ⌊SPP's authorities show a similar  
disagreement. He reads *bhávyam;* and the same reading⌋ in our text is  
evidently called for.
