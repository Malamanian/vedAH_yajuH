title = "०४ यः प्राणेन"

## Translation
4. Who gratifies heaven-and-earth with breath; who fills the belly of  
the ocean with respiration—against that god etc. etc.

## Notes
The meter is correctly enough described by the Anukr. The omission of  
either *apānena* or *samudrasya* would rectify the meter of **b**.
