## Translation
19. Harnessed eight-fold draws the formidable draft-horse (*váhni*),  
father of gods, generator of prayers (*mati*); measuring with the mind  
the line of righteousness, Mātariśvan goes cleansing (*pū*) to all the  
quarters.—Against that god etc. etc.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Or perhaps 'he goes as Mātariśvan,' identifying the action of sun and of  
wind. *Mimā́nas* in **c** should be emended to *mímānas*, which is read  
only by D. The Anukr. notices this time the redundant syllable in **a**.
