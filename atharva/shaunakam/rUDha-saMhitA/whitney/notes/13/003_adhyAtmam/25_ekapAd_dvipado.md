title = "२५ एकपाद् द्विपदो"

## Translation
25. The one-footed strode out more than the two-footed; the two-footed  
falls upon the three-footed from behind; the four-footed acted within  
the call of the two-footed ones, beholding the series (*pan̄tí*), drawing  
near (*upa-sthā*).—Against that god etc. etc.

## Notes
The first two pādas are identical with 2. 27 **a, b**, and the whole  
verse corresponds to RV. X. 117. 8. RV. reads in **a** *bhū́yo dvipádo*,  
in **b** *dvipā́t tripā́dam*, in **c** *eti* (for *cakre*) *dvipádām*, in  
**d** *pan̄ktī́r up-*. The accentuation *dvípāt* and *trípāt* (only in  
these verses) was noticed under 2. 27. Here we lack two syllables of a  
full *vikṛti*.
