## Translation
20. A united (*saviyáñc*) line along all the directions, within the  
*gāyatrī́*, the womb (embryo?) of the immortal.—Against that god etc.  
etc.

## Notes
'Line' here is accus., as taking up and carrying on the idea of 19  
**c**. The verse lacks two syllables of being a full *atyaṣṭi* (68  
syll.).
