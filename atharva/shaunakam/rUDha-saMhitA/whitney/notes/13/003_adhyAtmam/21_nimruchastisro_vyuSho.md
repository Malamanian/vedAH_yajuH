## Translation
21. Three settings, dawnings also three; three welkins, skies verily  
three: we know, O Agni, the birth-place of thee threefold; threefold the  
births of the gods we know.—Against that god etc. etc.

## Notes
The verse is regular if *tredhā́* in **c** (not in **d**) is made, as  
often elsewhere, trisyllabic.
