## Translation
9. Black the descent, the yellow eagles, clothing themselves in waters,  
fly up to the sky; they have come hither from the seat of  
righteousness—against that god etc. etc.

## Notes
The first three pādas are RV. i. 164. 47 **a-c**, found also twice  
above, as vi. 22. 1; ix. 10. 22. The verse (7 × 11 = 77) is accurately  
described by the Anukr. It, with a good part of those that follow  
(11-16, 18-21, 23, 25), appears to have nothing to do with the refrain.
