## Translation
18. Seven harness a one-wheeled chariot; one horse, having seven names,  
draws \[it\]; of three naves \[is\] the wheel, unwasting, unassailed,  
whereon stand all these existences.—Against that god etc. etc.

## Notes
We had the verse (which is RV. i. 164. 2) above as ix. 9. 2. The mss.  
all give it in full here (as in the case of vs. 14 above).
