title = "२५ रोहितो दिवमारुहत्"

## Translation
25. The ruddy one hath mounted the sky with penance, \[he\] rich in  
penance; he comes to the womb (*yóni*), he is born again; he hath become  
over-lord of the gods.

## Notes
Ppp. reads in **a** *ā ’kramīt*. The Anukr. regards the verse as one of  
four pādas (8 + 6: 12 + 11); but the first two are plainly one  
*triṣṭubh* pāda, with *tápasā* intruded into it. *Rohita* appears here  
for the first time in this second hymn, instead of simply the sun; nor  
do we meet him elsewhere, save in vss. 39-41.
