## Translation
7. Mount (*adhi-sthā*), O sun, thine easy-running chariot, rich in rays,  
pleasant, well-horsed, powerful (? *vājín*), which thy yellow steeds, of  
excellent draught, draw: a hundred horses, or else seven, numerous.

## Notes
All our mss. accent *sū́rya* in **a**; our edition emends to *sūrya*.  
Ppp. has in **b** *syonosyavahnim*. The Anukr. perhaps regards the  
redundant syllable in **b** as balanced by the deficiency in **a**. ⌊Cf.  
6 **c, d**.⌋
