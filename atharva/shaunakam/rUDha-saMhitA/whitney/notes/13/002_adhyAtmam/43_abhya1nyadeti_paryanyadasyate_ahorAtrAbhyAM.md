title = "४३ अभ्य१न्यदेति पर्यन्यदस्यतेऽहोरात्राभ्यां"

## Translation
43. The one he falls upon (*abhi-i*), the other he casts about—the bull,  
arranging with day-and-night; we, imploring, call upon the track-finding  
sun, dwelling in the welkin (*rájas*).

## Notes
In the very obscure first half-verse, the two *anyat's* may be subjects  
instead (so Ludwig and Henry), *asyate* being taken as passive—which  
would seem more natural, save that then the nominative in **b** is left  
without construction. Ppp. reads in **a-b** *eti sadyo ‘yaṁ vasāvam  
aho-*, and in **d** *nāthamānāḥ*. The verse (12 + 12: 11 + 12 = 47) is a  
very irregular '"*jagatī*."
