title = "४५ पर्यस्य महिमा"

## Translation
45. The greatness of him exceeds (*pári*) the earth, the ocean; shining  
abroad with light, it exceeds (*pári*) the sky, the atmosphere;  
beholding the all, beneficent, reverend, let him hear this which I say.

## Notes
Ppp. again objects to our second half-verse, and gives instead:  
*ahorātrābhyāṁ saha saṁvasānā uṣā nīyus pratarād aviṣṭam*. The  
"*jagatī*" is again a very rough one ⌊as the Anukr. in part admits⌋. ⌊W.  
interlines "encompasses" as an alternative to "exceeds."⌋
