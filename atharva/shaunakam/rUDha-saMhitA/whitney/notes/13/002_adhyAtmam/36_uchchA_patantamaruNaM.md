## Translation
36. Flying on high (*uccā́*), the red eagle, in the midst of the sky  
hasting, shining—may we see thee, whom men call the impeller (*savitṛ́*),  
the unfailing light which Atri found.

## Notes
Ppp. has the better reading *paśyema* in **c**. ⌊Restore the lost  
accent-mark under the *ṇim* of *taráṇim*.⌋
