## Translation
31. Hitherward from afar, extended (*pra-yam*) in mid-route, swift,  
inspired, flying, he the flying one, perceived (? *vícitta*) \[as\]  
Vishṇu, surpassing (*adhi-sthā*) with strength—he overpowers with his  
show (*ketú*) all that stirs.

## Notes
Ppp. reads at the beginning *arvāk*. ⌊'Perceived as Viṣṇu': cf. note to  
xiii. 4. 46.⌋
