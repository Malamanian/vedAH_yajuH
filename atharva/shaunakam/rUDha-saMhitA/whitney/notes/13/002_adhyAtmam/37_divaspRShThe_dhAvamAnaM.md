title = "३७ दिवस्पृष्ठे धावमानं"

## Translation
37. To the eagle running on the back of the sky, to the son of Aditi, I,  
frightened, approach (*upa-yā*), desiring refuge; do thou, O sun,  
lengthen out for us a long life-time; may we take no harm; may we be in  
thy favor.

## Notes
The verse is obviously a regular *triṣṭubh*, with *nāthákāmas* intruded  
in **b**: its description by the Anukr. ⌊gives the verse 48 syllables;  
but how *pañcapadā virāḍgarbhā* is to be understood is not clear⌋. ⌊The  
verse is quoted in Vāit. 18. 7, in the *agniṣṭoma*.⌋
