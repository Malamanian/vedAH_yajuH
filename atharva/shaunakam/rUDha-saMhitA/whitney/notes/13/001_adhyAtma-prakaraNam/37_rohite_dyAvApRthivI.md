## Translation
37. On the ruddy one are set (*śritá*) heaven-and-earth, on the  
goods-conquering, kine-conquering, booty-conquering one, of whom the  
births are a thousand and seven; may I speak thy navel on the range of  
existence.

## Notes
Ppp. reads for **b** *vasujid gojit saṁdhanājiti*, and in **c**  
*draviṇāni saptatir*. The obscure last pāda is identical with vs. 14  
**c**.
