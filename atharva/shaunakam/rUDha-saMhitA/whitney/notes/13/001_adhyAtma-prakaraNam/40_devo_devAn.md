title = "४० देवो देवान्"

+++
## Translation
40. Thou, a god, molestest (*mṛc*) the gods; thou goest about within the  
sea (*arṇavá*); they kindle the same fire; it the high (*pára*) poets  
know.

## Notes
'It,' i.e. 'the fire' (*tám*). Ppp. reads *marcayati* and *carati*.  
⌊Bloomfield, AJP. xii. 437, emends to *devám arcayasi;* but Ppp., and  
the antithesis of **a** and b, admirably suggested by Deussen's  
*dennoch*, are in favor of *marc-*.⌋
