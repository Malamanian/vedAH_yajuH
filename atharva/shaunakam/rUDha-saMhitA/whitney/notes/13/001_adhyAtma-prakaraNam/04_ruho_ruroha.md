title = "०४ रुहो रुरोह"

## Translation
4. The ruddy one ascended (*ruh*), mounted the ascents (*rúh*); \[he,\]  
the embryo of the wives, \[mounted\] the lap of births; him, taken hold  
of by them (f.), the six wide \[spaces\] discovered; seeing in advance  
the track, he hath brought (*ā-hṛ*) hither the kingdom.

## Notes
The verse is found also in TB. (ii. 5. 2¹), which reads in **a** (much  
better) *róhaṁ-rohaṁ* (for *rúho ruroha*), at the beginning of **b**  
*prajā́bhir vṛ́ddhim*, and in **c** *sáṁrabdho avidat*. Such variations  
are of interest especially as showing how little connected sense was  
recognized in these verses by those who established the texts. This  
verse has no right to the name of *jagatī*, since all its pādas have a  
trochaic close; the two redundant syllables in **a** and **c** are  
removed by the TB. readings. ⌊For *ā́hāḥ*, see Prāt. ii. 46.⌋ ⌊With  
regard to the transition-sound between *-dan* and *ṣáḍ*, see Prāt. ii.  
9, note.⌋
