## Translation
38. Glorious thou goest to the directions and quarters, glorious of  
cattle and of people (*carṣaṇí*); glorious in the lap of earth, of  
Aditi, may I become pleasant (*cā́ru*) like Savitar.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *nu* instead of *ca* in **a**, and *asmi* instead of  
*bhūyāsam* in **d**; and it combines *pṛthivyā ’di-* in **c**. There is  
a deficiency of a syllable, unnoticed in the Anukr., in **a**, unless we  
resolve *ya-āsi*.
