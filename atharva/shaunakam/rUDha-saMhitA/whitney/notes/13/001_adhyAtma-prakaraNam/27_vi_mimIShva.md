## Translation
27. Measure thou out (*vi-mā*) the milk-giving, ghee-dripping  
(*ghṛtā́ñc*) \[cow\]; this is the unresisting milch-cow of the gods. Let  
Indra drink the soma; let there be comfort (*kṣéma*); let Agni commence  
praising; do thou thrust away the scorners.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *eṣām* at end of **b**. With the verse is to be compared Āp.  
xi. 4. 14: *vi mime tvā payasvatīṁ devānāṁ dhenuṁ sudughām  
anapasphurantīm: indraḥ somam pibatu kṣemo astu naḥ*, which accompanies  
the measuring out of a *vedi* in shape of a cow. In Vāit. 15. 7; 28. 23,  
it is used in a like manner; and so also in Kāuś. 137. 10, in preparing  
for the *ājyatantra;* ⌊cf. also note to 137. 4⌋.
