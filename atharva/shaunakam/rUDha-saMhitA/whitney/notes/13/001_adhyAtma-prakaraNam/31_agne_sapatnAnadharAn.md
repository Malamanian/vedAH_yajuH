## Translation
31. O Agni, make our rivals fall below us; stagger the truculent  
(*utpípāna*) fellow, O Brihaspati; O Indra-and-Agni, O Mitra-and-Varuṇa,  
let them fall below \[us\], impotent in their fury.

## Notes
Lit. 'not making their fury effective against' us. The Anukr. apparently  
understands the structure of the verse as 12 + 14: 8 + 6 + 8 = 48; but  
there is no good reason for dividing the last redundant pāda into two.  
Ppp. reads *utapidānaṁ* (for *utpipānam* ⌊discussed AJP. xii. 441⌋) in  
**b**.
