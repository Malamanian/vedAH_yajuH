title = "२९ हन्त्वेनान् प्र"

## Translation
29. Let him slay them, burn \[them\] away,—the enemy (*ári*) who fights  
us; by the flesh-eating fire do we burn away our rivals.

## Notes
Ppp. reads in **a** *enāṁ;* we require *enaṁ*, as antecedent to **b**,  
which, as the verse now stands, seems to describe the subject of the  
verbs in **a**. Ppp. has also *agnis* for *aris* in **b**.
