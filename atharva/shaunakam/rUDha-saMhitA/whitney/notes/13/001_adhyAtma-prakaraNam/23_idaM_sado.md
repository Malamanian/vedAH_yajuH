title = "२३ इदं सदो"

## Translation
23. Here the seat (*sádas*), she that is ruddy, of the ruddy one; yonder  
the road by which the spotted one (f.) goes; her the Gandharvas, the  
Kaśyapas, lead up; her the poets defend unremittingly.

## Notes
All the mss. except O.D. (and these differ perhaps only by accident)  
read in **c** *gandharvāḥ*, as if vocative.
