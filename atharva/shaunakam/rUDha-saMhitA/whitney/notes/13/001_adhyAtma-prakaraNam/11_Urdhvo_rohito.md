## Translation
11. The ruddy one hath stood aloft upon the firmament (*nā́kā*),  
generating all forms, \[he,\] young, poet; Agni shineth forth with keen  
light; in the third space (*rájas*) he hath done dear things.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *bhāsi* in **c**. The Anukr. again passes without notice the  
*jagatī* pāda **b**. ⌊W. suggests by interlineation as alternative,  
'hath made for himself dear forms.'⌋
