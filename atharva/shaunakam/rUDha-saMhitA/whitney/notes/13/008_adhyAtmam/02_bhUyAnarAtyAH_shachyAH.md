## Translation
47. More than the niggard, lord of strength (*śácī*) art thou, O Indra;  
as called mighty, prevailing, do we worship (*upa-ās*) thee.

## Notes
Prāt. ii. 71 expressly forbids the combination *śácyās p-*, which we  
should have expected here. The verse (9 + 8: 8 = 25) is strangely  
defined by the Anukr.
