## Translation
51. As called water (*ámbhas*), red, silvery (*rajatá*), welkin  
(*rájas*), power, do we worship thee.

Again ⌊as at vs. 31⌋ we have a verse called *virāḍ gāyatrī* which lacks  
four syllables of being 24.  
  
    
  
\[**Paryāya VI.**—*pañca. 52, 53. prājāpatyā ’nuṣṭubh; 54. 2-p. ārṣī
