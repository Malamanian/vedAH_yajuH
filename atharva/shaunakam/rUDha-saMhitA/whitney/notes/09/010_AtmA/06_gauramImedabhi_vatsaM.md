## Translation
6. The cow lowed toward the winking calf; she uttered *hing* at \[its\]  
head, in order to lowing; bellowing the mouth (? *sṛ́kvan*) unto the hot  
drink, she lows a lowing, she abounds with milk.

## Notes
Compare 1. 8, above; the second line is nearly identical in the two  
verses. It is quite differently rendered by the translators at one and  
another point, being very obscure. For *abhí* in **a**, RV. reads *ánu*,  
Ppp. *apa*.
