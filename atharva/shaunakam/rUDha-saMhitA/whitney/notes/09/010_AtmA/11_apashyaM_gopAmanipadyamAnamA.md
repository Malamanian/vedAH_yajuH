## Translation
11. I saw the shepherd, not lying down, moving both hither and thither  
upon his roads; he, clothing himself in the collecting, he in the  
dispersing ones, rolls greatly on among existences.

## Notes
Doubtless the sun. The verse ⌊RV. vs. 31⌋ is found a second time in RV.  
as x. 177. 3; and also at VS. xxxvii. 17; TA. iv. 7. 1; M.S. iv. 9. 6;  
AA. ii. 1. 6⁶⁻¹⁰—all accenting in **a** *ánipadyamānam*, which is alone  
acceptable. ⌊Our **d** recurs, with *sá* prefixed, at x. 2. 7 **c**. If  
we read *varīvartti* there, we ought also to do so here.⌋ ⌊Cf.  
*Kaṭha-hss.*, p. 101.⌋
