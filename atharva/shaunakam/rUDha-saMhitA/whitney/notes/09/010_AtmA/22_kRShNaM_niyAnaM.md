## Translation
22. Black the descent, the yellow eagles, clothing themselves in  
waters, fly up to the sky; they have come hither from the seat of  
righteousness; then, forsooth, with ghee they deluged the earth.

## Notes
The verse occurs also above as vi. 22. 1, and pādas **a-c** below in  
xiii. 3. 9. For parallel passages etc. see die note to vi. 22. 1. It is  
RV. i. 164. 47, the last verse of the RV. hymn that is included in the  
AV. text here (RV. vss. 43-46 are our 25-28 below), although of the  
remaining five RV. vss. all but one (51) are found in other parts of our  
text.
