title = "२६ त्रयः केशिन"

## Translation
26. Three hairy ones look out seasonably; in the (a?) year one of them  
shears itself; another looks upon all with might (*śácībhis*); of one is  
seen the rush, not the form.

## Notes
The RV. version ⌊vs. 44⌋ has in **c** *víśam éko abhí caṣṭe;* our  
*abhicáṣṭe* is a regular case of antithetical accent. The RV.  
*pada*-text does not divide *saṁvatsare*. Haug interprets the verse of  
the three forms of Agni; Hillebrandt (*Ved. Mythol.*, i. p. 472), of the  
moon (!?), sun, and wind.
