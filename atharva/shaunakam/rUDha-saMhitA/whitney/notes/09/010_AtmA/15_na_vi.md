## Translation
15. I do not distinguish what this is that I am; I go secret, fastened  
together with mind; when the first-born of righteousness hath come to  
me, then indeed I attain a share of this speech.

## Notes
Ppp. agrees with RV. ⌊vs. 37⌋ in putting this verse ⌊and the next⌋ after  
our vs. 17. The RV. *pada*-text has in **c** *ā́: ágan* ⌊so Müller's five  
editions and Aufrecht's first: Aufrecht's second, *ā́: agan*⌋; our  
*ā॰ágan* is better. Ppp. reads *balinā* for *manasā* in **b**.
