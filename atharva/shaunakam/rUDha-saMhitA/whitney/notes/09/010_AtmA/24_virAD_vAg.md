## Translation
24. *Virā́j* \[is\] speech, *virā́j* earth, *virā́j* atmosphere, *virā́j*  
Prajāpati; *virā́j* became death, the over-king of the perfectibles  
(*sādhyá*); in his control are what was, what is to be; let him put in  
my control what was, what is to be.

## Notes
⌊Prose.⌋ This verse, with all that follows it, is wanting in Ppp. The  
Anukr. reckons the whole first part to the pause as one pāda (20  
syllables, a *kṛti*-pāda); the *pada*-text understands it as two,  
dividing after *pṛthivī*.
