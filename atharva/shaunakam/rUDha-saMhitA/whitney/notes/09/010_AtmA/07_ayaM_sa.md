## Translation
7. This one here twangs, by whom the cow is surrounded; she lows a  
lowing, being set (*śritá*) on the sparkler (*dhvasáni*); since she put  
down mortals by her thoughts (*cittí*), becoming the lightning, she  
threw (*ūh*) back the wrap.

## Notes
Both RV. ⌊vs. 29⌋ and Ppp. read *mártyam* in **c**.
