## Translation
3. By the *jágatī* he established (*skabh*) the river in the sky; in the  
*rathaṁtará* he beheld (*pari-paś*) the sun; they call the three  
kindlers (*samídh*) the *gāyatrī́*-verse's; it was superior to them by  
bulk, by greatness.

## Notes
The translation of the last pāda is not without uncertainties; *tátas*  
is here understood as *quasi*-object of *prá ririce*. RV. ⌊vs. 25⌋ reads  
in **a** *astabhāyat*.
