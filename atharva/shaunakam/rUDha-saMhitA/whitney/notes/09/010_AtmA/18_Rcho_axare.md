## Translation
18. In the syllable of the verse (*ṛ́c*) in the highest firmament, on  
which all the gods sat down: he who knoweth not that, what will he do  
with the verse? they who know that sit together yonder.

## Notes
RV. ⌊vs. 39⌋ reads *imé* instead of *amī́* in **d**. O. combines *vidúṣ  
ṭé* just before it. The verse is found also in TB. iii. 10. 9¹⁴ and TA.  
ii. 11. 1—in both, with the RV. reading. Its *pratīka* occurs also in  
GB. i. 22. Read *véda* in **c**.
