## Translation
17. Seven half-embryos, the seed of existence, stand in front (?  
*pradíśā*), in Vishṇu's distribution; they, by thoughts (*dhītí*), by  
mind, they, inspired, surround on all sides the surrounders.

## Notes
Or, 'being surrounders.' As noted above, the verse in RV. ⌊vs. 36⌋ and  
Ppp. stands before our vs. 15. Both 17 and 18 are defective as  
*jagatīs*. ⌊Cf. Oldenberg, IFA. vi. 184; also Henry, *Actes du dixième  
Congrès intern. des Orientalistes*, Section I, Inde, p. 45-50, "Cruelle  
énigme."⌋
