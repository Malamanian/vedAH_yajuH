## Translation
19. Them that are hitherward they call off-ward; them, again, that are  
off-ward they call hitherward; what things, O Soma, thou and Indra have  
done, those they draw, harnessed as it were with the pole of the welkin.

## Notes
The verse is found also in JB. i. 279, with no various readings that are  
not evident corruptions. The 'them' of **a, b** is masc., probably the  
same with the 'they' of **d** (*yuktā́ḥ*, p.). Ppp. reads *niyuktā*  
instead of *na yuktā*.
