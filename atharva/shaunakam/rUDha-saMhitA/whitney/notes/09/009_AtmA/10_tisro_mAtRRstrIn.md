title = "१० तिस्रो मातॄस्त्रीन्"

## Translation
10. The one, bearing three mothers \[and\] three fathers, stood  
upright; verily they do not exhaust him; on the back of yon sky the  
all-knowing ones talk a speech not found by all.

## Notes
RV. reads *glāpayanti* at end of **b** ⌊and the translation follows that  
reading⌋, and, for **d**, *viśvavídaṁ vā́cam áviśvaminvām*. The  
*pada*-text reads *glapayanta;* Prāt. iv. 93 notes the case. Ppp. agrees  
with RV. in *glāpayanti* and *viśvavidam*.
