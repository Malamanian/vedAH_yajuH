## Translation
7. I, not understanding (*cit*), ask here the understanding poets, I  
unknowing (*vid*), them that know; he who propped asunder these six  
spaces (*rájas*), in the form of the goat (? *ajá*)—was that also alone?

## Notes
The sense of the last pāda is utterly obscure, and the version given  
only tentative; *ajá* is perhaps here really the 'unborn one,' as the  
translators render it. RV. reads in **a** *ácikitvāñ cik-*, and, in  
**b**, *vidmáne*, for which our *vidvánas* is apparently a mere  
corruption.
