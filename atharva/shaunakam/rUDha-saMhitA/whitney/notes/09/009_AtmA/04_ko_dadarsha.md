## Translation
4. Who saw it first in process of birth, as the boneless one bears  
(*bhṛ*) him that has bones? where forsooth the earth's life (*ásu*),  
blood, soul? who shall go to ask that of him who knows?

## Notes
'Bears,' not in the sense of 'gives birth to,' but of 'carries' or  
'supports' or the like.
