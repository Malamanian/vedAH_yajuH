title = "१४ सनेमि चक्रमजरं"

## Translation
14. The unwasting wheel, with rim, rolls about; ten harnessed ones draw  
upon the outstretched one (fem.); the sun's eye goes surrounded with the  
welkin (*rájas*), in which stood all existences.

## Notes
Ppp. has *vrajanti* for *vahanti* in **b**, and, for **d** *yasminn  
ārpitā bhuvanāny ārpitā;* RV. has *tásminn ā́rpitā* for our *yásminn  
ātasthúḥ*. The Anukr. calls the verse simply a *jagatī*, though only two  
of its pādas have 12 syllables.
