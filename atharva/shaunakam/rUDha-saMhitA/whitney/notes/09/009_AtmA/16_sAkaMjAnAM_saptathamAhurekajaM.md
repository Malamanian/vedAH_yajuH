title = "१६ साकंजानां सप्तथमाहुरेकजं"

## Translation
16. Of those born together the seventh they call sole-born; six, they  
say, are twins, god-born seers; the sacrifices (? *iṣṭá*) of them,  
distributed according to their abodes, quake in their station, being  
altered (*vi-kṛ*) in respect to form.

## Notes
*Iṣṭā́ni* in **c** might equally mean 'things desired.' *Sthātré* in  
**d** is most probably loc. of *-trá*, since, if from *sthātṛ́*, we  
should expect instead the ablative. ⌊The vs. recurs at TA. i. 3. 1 with  
*udyamā́s* for *íd yamā́s*.⌋
