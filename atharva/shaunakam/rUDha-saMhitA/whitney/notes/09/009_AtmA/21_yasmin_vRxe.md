title = "२१ यस्मिन् वृक्षे"

## Translation
21. On what tree the honey-eating eagles all settle and give birth—what  
they call the sweet berry in the top of it, that cannot he attain who  
knoweth not \[his\] father.

## Notes
RV. has *íd āhuḥ* instead of *yád āhúḥ* in **c**, and so also Ppp. (but  
*āhuṣ*). In RV. this verse follows after our vs. 22. There is a  
redundant syllable in **c** of which the Anukr. takes no notice (and the  
pāda is also capable of being crowded together into eleven syllables).
