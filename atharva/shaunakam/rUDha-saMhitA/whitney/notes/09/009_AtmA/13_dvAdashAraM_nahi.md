title = "१३ द्वादशारं नहि"

## Translation
13. The twelve-spoked wheel—for that is not to be worn out—revolves  
greatly about the sky of righteousness; there, O Agni, stood the sons,  
paired, seven hundred and twenty.

## Notes
Here the 'twelve' and the 'seven hundred and twenty' are plainly the  
months, and the days and nights, of the year of 360 days. The verse, as  
noted above, is vs. 11 in RV. and Ppp. The more proper reading in **b**  
would be *várvartti*.
