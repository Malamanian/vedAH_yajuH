## Translation
5. The falcon his breast (*kroḍá*), the atmosphere his belly (?  
*pājasyà*), Brihaspati his hump, the *bṛhatī́s* his vertebrae.

## Notes
The sense of *bṛhatī* here is doubtful. Ppp. reads *pājasyaṁ* and  
inserts our vs. 7 after it ⌊continuing with *bṛhasp*-⌋. The required  
number of 24 syllables is made out by reading *kroḍó ant-* and  
*pājasí-am*.
