## Translation
1. Verily from sky, from earth, from atmosphere, from ocean, from fire,  
from wind was born the honey-whip; noting (*cāy*) it, \[as\] putting on  
immortality, all creatures (*prajā́*) rejoice to meet it with their  
hearts.

## Notes
The irregularities of meter in **a** and **c** may be rectified ⌊very  
unsatisfactorily⌋ by combining *pṛthivyā́ ’nt-* (as Ppp. actually reads)  
and resolving *cāyitu-ā́*. *Divás p-* is prescribed by Prāt. ii. 68.
