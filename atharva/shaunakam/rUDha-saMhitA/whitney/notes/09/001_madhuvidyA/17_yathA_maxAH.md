title = "१७ यथा मक्षाः"

## Translation
17. As the flies (*mákṣā*) smear down here honey upon honey, so, O  
Aśvins, let my splendor, brilliancy, strength, and force be maintained.

## Notes
In **a**, delete the superfluous accent-mark under *dhu*. Ppp. has quite  
another version of **a, b**: *yathā makṣā mayuntyujaṁ dakṣiṇām adhi:*  
and it omits *balam ojas* in **d**. The omission of any one of the three  
nouns in our **d** would rectify the meter.
