## Translation
8. She that, crying much, great, vigor-bestowing, loud-noised, goes unto  
her course (? *vratá*), bellowing at three *gharmás*—she lows a lowing,  
she abounds (*pī*) with milk (*páyas*).

## Notes
'Crying loudly,' lit. 'making to excess the sound *hing*'; 'abounds with  
milk,' perhaps rather 'gives milk in streams.' The verse is very  
obscure; it is in part identical with 10. 6 below (= RV. i. 164. 28).  
Its irregular meter (11 + 10 \[11?\]: 9 + 11 = 41 syllables) is very ill  
defined by the Anukr. ⌊which seems to scan as 11 + 9: 9 + 11⌋.
