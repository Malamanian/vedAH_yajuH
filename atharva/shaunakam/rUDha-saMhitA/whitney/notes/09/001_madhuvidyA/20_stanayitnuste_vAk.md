## Translation
20. Thunder \[is\] thy voice, O Prajāpati; a bull, thou castest  
vehemence on the earth, on the sky; upon that live all cattle; with this  
it lavishes (*pṛ*) food (*íṣ*) \[and\] refreshment.

## Notes
The first half-verse is the same with 10 **a, b**, saving *diví* for  
*ádhi* at the end. 'That' in **c** is fem. (*tā́m*), and might refer  
either to 'voice' or to 'earth'; 'this' is masc. (or neut., *téna*), and  
might refer either to 'vehemence' or to 'sky'; while 'it' is again fem.  
The obscurity of the verse baffles interpretation. The Pet. Lex.  
suggests 'seed' as a possible rendering of *śúṣma* ('vehemence'). The  
metrical description of the Anukr. is, as usual in such an irregular  
case (10+ 12: 11 + 9 \[11?\] = 42), quite worthless. Ppp. omits the  
first pāda, reads *divas* for *divi* at the end of the second, and goes  
on thus: *madhoṣ kaśayoṣ pṛthivīm anakṣi tāṁ dātāraṁ paśava upa jīvanti:  
sarve tena vo śeṣam ūrjaṁ bibharti*.
