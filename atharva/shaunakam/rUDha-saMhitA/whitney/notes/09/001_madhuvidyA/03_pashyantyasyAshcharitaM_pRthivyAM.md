## Translation
3. Men, manifoldly meditating (*mimāṅs-*) severally see its movement  
(*caritá*) on the earth; verily from fire, from wind was born the  
honey-whip, the formidable daughter (*naptí*) of the Maruts.

## Notes
Pāda **c** is identical with 1 **b**, pādas **c, d** with 10 **c, d**.  
Ppp. reads at end of **a** *pṛthivyāṣ;* at end of **d**, *ugrā anapatiḥ*  
(also in vs. 10).
