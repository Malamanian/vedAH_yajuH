## Translation
9. Whom, when fattened, the waters wait upon, the mighty (*śākvará*)  
bulls that are self-ruling, they rain, they cause to rain, for him who  
knows this, his desire, refreshment, waters.

## Notes
'Whom' is fem.; 'they' (**c**) is masc, = the bulls. Parts of this verse  
and the following one are lost in Ppp. The Anukr. ⌊seems to scan as 11 +  
11: 9 + 9⌋.
