## Translation
3. When in truth the lord of guests meets with his eyes the guests, he  
looks at a sacrificing to the gods.

## Notes
Ppp. reads at the beginning *yad atithipatiḥ preṣyate*. The verse has  
one syllable too many for a regular *sāmnī triṣṭubh;* but the system of  
nomenclature affords no ⌊simple⌋ name for one of 23 syllables.
