## Translation
19. In that he says "take up the larger one," he thereby makes his  
breath longer (*várṣīyāṅs*).

## Notes
Ppp. has a quite different text: *yad āha bhūyo ’ddhara te prajāṁ cāt  
’va paśūṅś ca vardhayate...* (?) prāṇaṁ kṛṇute: yat saṁpṛchati kāmam eva  
tenā ’va rundhe: kāmo ha pṛṣṭo yājāti: yad udakam upasiñcaty apa eva  
tenā ’va rundhe. ⌊Then follows 20.⌋
