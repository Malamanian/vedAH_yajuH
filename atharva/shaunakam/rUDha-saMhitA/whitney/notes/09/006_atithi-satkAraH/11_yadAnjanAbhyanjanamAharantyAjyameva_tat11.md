## Translation
11. In that they fetch ointment and unguent, that is sacrificial butter.

## Notes
The *pada*-reading *āñjana॰abhyañjanā* is quoted under Prāt. iv. 42, as  
example of words that lose their own individual division in favor of  
separation from each other. Ppp. omits *āñjana*. The Anukr. reads 16  
syllables, which may be obtained in more than one way (most probably  
*-ranti āj-*).
