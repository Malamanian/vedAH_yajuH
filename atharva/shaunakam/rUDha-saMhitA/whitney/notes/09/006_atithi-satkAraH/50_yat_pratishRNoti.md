## Translation
50. When \[the distributor\] assents, then he is just answering the  
summons.

## Notes
That is, as an *agnīdh*. Again, to justify the definition of the Anukr.,  
we must read *prati-ā́śrāvayati evá*. ⌊A hyphen is missing after the  
*pra* of *pratyā́śr-*.⌋ Ppp. again omits *eva tat* at the end.
