title = "२७ सर्वदा वा"

## Translation
27. Verily he who presents \[the food\] hath always his pressing-stones  
harnessed, his cleanser wet, his sacrifice extended, his ceremony of  
offering assumed.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *sutasomas* instead of *yuktagrāvā*, and puts *vitatādhvaras*  
as last of the four epithets; it also sets the whole paragraph after our  
28.
