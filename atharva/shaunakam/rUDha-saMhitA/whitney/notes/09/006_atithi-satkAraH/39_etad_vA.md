## Translation
39. That verily is specially sweet which comes from the cow  
(*adhigavá*), either milk (*kṣīrá*) or flesh; that he should not partake  
of.

## Notes
That is, doubtless, he should leave it for his guest. The verse is  
wanting in Ppp. The so-called *gāyatrī* is to be thus divided: 7 + 11 +  
6 = 24.
