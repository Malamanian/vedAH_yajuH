## Translation
37. He verily is a guest, namely (*yát*) one versed in sacred learning  
(*śrótriya*); before him one should not partake.

## Notes
The meaning intended ought to be that a guest is the equivalent of such  
a sage; but the literal sense is as translated. The verse lacks one  
syllable (unless we read *ná aśnīyāt*) of being full measure.
