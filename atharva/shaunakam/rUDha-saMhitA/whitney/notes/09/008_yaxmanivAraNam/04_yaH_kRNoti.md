## Translation
4. Whatever one makes a man dumb (? *pramóta*), makes \[him\]  
blind—every head-disease etc. etc.

## Notes
'Dumb' for pramóta is Zimmer's conjecture; the word is wholly obscure,  
and form, accent, and meter make it suspicious; one is tempted to  
conjecture *prámohitam;* but *muh* with prefix *pra* is not a Vedic  
combination. The Anukr. takes no notice of the defective pāda.
