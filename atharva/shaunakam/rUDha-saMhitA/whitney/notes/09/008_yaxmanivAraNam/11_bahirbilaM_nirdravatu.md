## Translation
11. Forth at the orifice let it run out, the *kā́hābāha*, from thy  
belly; the poison of all etc. etc.

## Notes
⌊Literally 'to the orifice'; Henry "vers le trou," i.e. "par l'anus."⌋  
The Pet. Lexx. plausibly conjecture *kāhābāha* to be an imitative term  
for rumbling in the bowels; it may also possibly be understood as used  
adverbially, like *bāl* in i. 3. Ppp. has a quite different reading for  
**b**: *kahāvalaṁ tvaṅdarā*.
