## Translation
17. They that creep along the intestines, and confound the entrails—not  
injuring etc. etc.

## Notes
Ppp. reads in **b** *yāpayanti* for *mohayanti*. ⌊Roth most ingeniously  
suggests that the Ppp. reading may mean *āntrā, ni-y-āmayanti*. Or is  
*yāpayanti* to be taken in a sense quite like our English 'cause (the  
bowels) to move,' i.e. 'produce diarrhœa'?⌋
