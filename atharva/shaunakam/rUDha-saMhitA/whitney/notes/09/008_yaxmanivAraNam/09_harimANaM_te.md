title = "०९ हरिमाणं ते"

## Translation
9. Yellowness from thy limbs, *apvā́* from thy belly within, the  
*yákṣma*-maker from thy self within we expel etc. etc.

## Notes
The *pada*-text reads in **c** *yakṣmaḥ॰dhā́m*. The Prāt. takes no notice  
of the irregular form of the first member of the compound, as it does,  
superfluously (ii. 56), of the contrary treatment of *śepas* in  
*śepa॰harṣaṇīm*. In Ppp. our third pāda becomes the second, and for  
third we have nearly our 7 **c**: *yakṣmaṁ te sarvam an̄gebhyo*.
