title = "१२ पार्श्वे आस्तामनुमत्या"

## Translation
12. His sides were Anumati's; his flanks (? *anūvṛ́j*) were Bhaga's; of  
his knees (*aṣṭhīvánt*) Mitra said: those are wholly mine.

## Notes
All the nouns are duals. The Anukr. takes no notice of the redundant  
syllable in **c**. ⌊Henry would emend thus: -*vántābrav*-, i.e. -*vántā  
abrav*-. Ppp. reads at the beginning *pārśvay āstām*.
