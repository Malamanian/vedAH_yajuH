title = "११ य इन्द्र"

## Translation
11. He who goes speaking out greatly among the kine, like Indra among  
the gods—of that bull let the worshiper (*brahmán*) praise together the  
members excellently.

## Notes
All our mss. (save O.) read, like the edition, *tásya ṛṣa-* in **c**,  
although the passage is quoted as example under the Prāt. rule (iii. 46)  
that *a* or *ā* + *ṛ* make *ar*. Ppp. reads in **a** *āindrī ’va*. The  
*paddhati* (note to Kāuś. 24. 19) has the verse whispered in the right  
ear of the released bull.
