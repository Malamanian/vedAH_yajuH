## Translation
10. Brihaspati, Savitar bestowed on thee vigor (*váyas*); from Tvashṭar,  
from Vāyu was brought forth thy soul (*ātmán*); with mind in the  
atmosphere I make offering (*hu*) of thee; let heaven-and-earth both be  
thy *barhís*.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *manas* for *vayas* in **a**. The Anukr. calls the verse  
*jagatī*, though two of its pādas are *triṣṭubh*.
