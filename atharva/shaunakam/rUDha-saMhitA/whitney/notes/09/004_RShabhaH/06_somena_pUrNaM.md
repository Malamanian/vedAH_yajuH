## Translation
6. Thou bearest a vessel filled with soma, shaper (*tvástṛ*) of forms,  
generator of cattle; propitious to thee be these pudenda (? *prajanū́*)  
that are here; to us, O ax, confirm those that are yonder.

## Notes
Ppp. reads at the beginning *somasya;* its second half-verse is  
unintelligible. The verse is with no propriety called a *jagatī* (11 +  
11: 13 + 12 = 47).
