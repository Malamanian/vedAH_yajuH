title = "२१ अयं पिपान"

## Translation
21. Let this burly (*pípāna*) one, a very Indra, bestow conspicuous  
wealth; let this one \[bestow\] a well-milking cow, constantly with  
calf; let him yield (*duh*) inspired will beyond the sky.

## Notes
Ppp. has very different readings, which in part are less unacceptable  
than those of our text: for **a, b**, *ayaṁ pipānā indriyaṁ gayāṁ  
bibharti tejanī:* in **d**, *vipaśyataṁ puro divaḥ*. ⌊For *pípāna*, cf.  
Bloomfield, AJP. xii. 443.⌋
