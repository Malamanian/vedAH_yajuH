## Translation
15. His breast (*kroḍá*) was Jāmiśaṅsa's; his vessel \[was\] maintained  
as Soma's, when all the gods, coming together, distributed  
(*vi-kalpay-*) the bull.

## Notes
We had *jāmiśaṅsa* above (ii. 10. 1) as 'imprecation of sisters'; the  
word does not occur elsewhere. What part of the bull is his 'vessel' is  
obscure. The first pāda has a redundant syllable.
