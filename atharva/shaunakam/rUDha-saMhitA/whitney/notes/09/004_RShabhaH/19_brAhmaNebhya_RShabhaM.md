title = "१९ ब्राह्मणेभ्य ऋषभं"

## Translation
19. Having given a bull to Brahmans, one makes his mind wider; he  
beholds (*ava-paś*) prosperity of the inviolable \[kine\] in his own  
stall.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Ppp. reads in **a** *brāhmaṇāya vṛṣabhaṁ*, and in **d** *vi paśyatu*. In  
**a**, we have to combine (as not very rarely elsewhere) *-bhya rṣ-*.
