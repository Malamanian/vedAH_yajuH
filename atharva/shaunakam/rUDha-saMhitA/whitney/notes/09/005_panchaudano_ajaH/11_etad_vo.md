## Translation
11 . This third light of yours, O Fathers, the goat with five  
rice-dishes one gives to a priest; the goat, given in this world by one  
having faith, smites far away the darknesses.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The second half-verse is identical with 7 **c, d** above. Ppp. has, for  
**d**, *pañcodano brahmaṇe dīyamānaḥ* (our 9 **c**, 10 **c**).
