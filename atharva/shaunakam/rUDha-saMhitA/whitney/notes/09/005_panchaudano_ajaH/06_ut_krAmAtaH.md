## Translation
6. Step up from here, if thou hast been completely heated, from the  
heated pot on to the third firmament; thou, a fire, hast come into being  
out of fire; conquer \[thy way\] unto that world of light.

## Notes
The translation of **a** implies the emendation to *átapthās*, which  
seems very probable; nearly all the mss. read *ataptās* (only E. *áta-*,  
P.M. *ataptas*), which the edition has altered to *átaptas*. Of the  
reading in Ppp. I have no note; Ppp. reads for **d** *jyotiṣmo acha  
sukṛtāṁ yatra lokaḥ;* our **d** is found (nearly) as its 8 **d**.
