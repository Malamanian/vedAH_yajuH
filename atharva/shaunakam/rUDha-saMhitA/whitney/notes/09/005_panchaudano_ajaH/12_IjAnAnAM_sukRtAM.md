## Translation
12. Desiring to obtain the world of the well-doing that have made  
offerings, one gives to a priest a goat with five rice-dishes; do thou  
conquer complete attainment (*vyā̀pti*) unto that world; be he, accepted,  
propitious to us.

## Notes
Ppp. begins *pra jyotiṣmantaṁ sukṛtāṁ lok-;* and reads **c, d** thus:  
*sa vyāpo neṅṣ abhi lokaṁ jayā ’sme śivo ‘smabhyaṁ pratigṛhyate ‘dhi*.
