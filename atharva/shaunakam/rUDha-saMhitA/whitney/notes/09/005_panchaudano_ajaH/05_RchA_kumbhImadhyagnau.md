## Translation
5. With a verse I set the kettle upon the fire; pour thou on the water;  
set him down; set \[him\] about with fire, ye quellers; when cooked, let  
him go where is the world of the well-doing.

## Notes
Ppp. has instead, for **a**, *bhūmyāṁ bhūmim adhi dhārayāmi;* and, in  
**b**, *abhi* for *ava*. The successive parts of the verse are quoted in  
Kāuś. 64. 11-15, to accompany corresponding acts. The Anukr. does not  
heed the redundant syllable in **d**.
