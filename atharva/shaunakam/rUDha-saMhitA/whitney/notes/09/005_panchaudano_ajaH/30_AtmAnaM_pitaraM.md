title = "३० आत्मानं पितरं"

## Translation
30. Self, father, son, grandson, grandfather, wife, generatrix, mother,  
those who are dear—them I call upon.

## Notes
Nor does the Anukr. heed the deficient syllables in **b** of this verse.  
⌊We might render *jánitrīm mātáram* by 'the mother that bore \[me\].'⌋
