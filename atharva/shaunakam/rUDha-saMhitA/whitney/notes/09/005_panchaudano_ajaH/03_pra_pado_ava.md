title = "०३ प्र पदोऽव"

## Translation
3. Away from his foot wash thou down the evil walk that he walked  
(*car*); with cleansed hoofs let him step on, foreknowing; crossing the  
darknesses, variously looking abroad let the goat step unto the third  
firmament.

## Notes
Or *padás* in **a** may be accus. pl.; the redundancy of the pāda, in  
sense and meter, is an indication of intrusion; but the mode of its  
reduction to proper shape is not obvious, and Ppp. gives no help. Ppp.  
has, instead of our **c, d**, *te jyotiṣmantaṁ sukṛtāl lokam īpsan  
tṛtīye nāke adhi vikramasva*.
