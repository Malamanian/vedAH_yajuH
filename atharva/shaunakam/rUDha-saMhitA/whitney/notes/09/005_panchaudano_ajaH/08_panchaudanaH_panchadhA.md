## Translation
8. Having five rice-dishes, let him step out five-fold, about to step  
unto the three lights; go thou forth to the midst of the well-doing that  
have made offerings; spread out (*vi-śri*) upon the third firmament.

## Notes
The last pāda is the same with xviii. 4. 3 **e**; Ppp. has instead  
*jyotiṣmantam abhi lokaṁ jayā ’smāi*, with which compare our 6 **d**.  
The Anukr. passes in silence the irregularities of the second pāda. ⌊Cf.  
Oldenberg, ZDMG. l. 449.⌋
