## Translation
10. The goat sets him that has given it on the three-firmamented,  
three-heavened, three-backed back of the firmament; being given with  
five rice-dishes to a priest, thou art a single milch-cow, all-formed,  
wish-yielding.

## Notes
Ppp. reads in **b** *sukṛtāṁ lake* for *nākasya pṛṣṭhe;* and our **d**  
is its 9 **d**, with the intrusive *dhenus* left out. The verse, in  
spite of its irregularity, is by the Anukr. reckoned simply a *jagatī*  
(11 + 12: 11 + 12 \[13?\]).
