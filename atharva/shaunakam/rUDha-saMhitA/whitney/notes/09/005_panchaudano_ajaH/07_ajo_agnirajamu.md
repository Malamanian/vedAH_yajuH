## Translation
7. The goat \[is\] Agni, and they call the goat light; they say that the  
goat is to be given by one living to a priest (*brahmán*); the goat,  
given in this world by one having faith, smites far away the darknesses.

## Notes
For the first two words Ppp. reads *ajam evā ’gnim;* in **b**, it puts  
*jīvatā* after *brahmaṇe*. The redundant syllable in **b** is not  
noticed by the Anukr. ⌊See note under 8.⌋
