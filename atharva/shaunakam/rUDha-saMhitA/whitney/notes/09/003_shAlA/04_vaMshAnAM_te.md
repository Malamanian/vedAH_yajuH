## Translation
4. Of thy beams (*vaṅśá*), ties (*náhana*), and binding (*prāṇāhá*)  
grass, of thy sides (*pakṣá*), O thou that possessest all choice things,  
we unfasten the tied \[parts\].

## Notes
*Vaṅśá* is properly a bamboo beam. *Prāṇāhá* (unchanged in *pada*-text)  
seems to occur only here, nor is root *nah* elsewhere combined with  
*pra;* I have ventured to render it as an adj., as *tṛ́ṇa* appears to  
call for a descriptive epithet. Ppp. reads *naddhān vi* in **d**.
