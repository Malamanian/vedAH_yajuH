title = "१७ तृणैरावृता पलदान्"

## Translation
17. Wrapped (*ā-vṛ*) with grass, clothing itself in *paladás*, the  
dwelling, place of rest (*nivéśanī*) of living creatures, like the  
night—built on the earth thou standest, like a she-elephant, having  
feet.

## Notes
That is, apparently, heavy and big on the four corner posts, like an  
elephant (female because 'dwelling' is feminine) on its feet. With **b**  
compare xii. i. 6 **b**. The verse as a *prastārapan̄kti* (11 + 12: 8 +  
8) has no irregularity which the Anukr. is wont to heed.
