## Translation
9. He who, O dwelling, accepts thee, and he by whom thou art built—let  
both those, O mistress of the building, live to attain old age.

## Notes
The *mā́nasya* of the mss. in **c** is again emended in our edition to  
*mān-*. Ppp. rectifies the meter of **a** by reading *yaś citrā (ca  
tvā?) pr-*. The Anukr. pays no heed to the irregularity of the verse (9  
+ 8: 8 + 7).
