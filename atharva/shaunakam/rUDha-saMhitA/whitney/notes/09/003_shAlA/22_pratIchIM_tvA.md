## Translation
22. I go forward, O dwelling, turned toward thee, uninjuring, that art  
turned toward me; for within \[are\] fire and waters, the first door of  
right (*ṛtá*).

## Notes
Ppp. reads at the end *prathamobhā*. The mss. all have *ca rtásya* in  
**c-d**. The verse is quoted in Kāuś. 66. 25, accompanying the action of  
'going forward with (*ādāya*) water-pot \[and\] fire.'
