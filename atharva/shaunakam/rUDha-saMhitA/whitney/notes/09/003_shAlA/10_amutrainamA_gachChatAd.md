title = "१० अमुत्रैनमा गच्छताद्"

## Translation
10. Do thou, made firm, tied, adorned (*pari-kṛ*), go to him yonder—thou  
whose every limb, whose every joint we unfasten.

## Notes
O. reads in **a** *amútrāi ’ṇam*. *Páriṣkṛtā* is unaltered in the  
*pada*-text, as prescribed by Prāt. iv. 58. *Enam* probably indicates  
the "acceptor" (9 **a**, 15). Ppp. reads in **b** *tridhā* for *dṛḍhā*,  
and begins **c** with *tasyas*. ⌊As to *amútra*, cf. Oldenberg, IFA. vi.  
179.⌋
