## Translation
16. What sufficient (*udbhú*) triply-guarding defense thou hast, O Kāma,  
worship (*bráhman*) as extended protection (*várman*), made  
unpierceable, with that do thou avoid them that are my rivals; let  
breath, cattle, life avoid them.

## Notes
The last half-verse is ⌊nearly⌋ identical with 5 **c, d** above, and O.  
again reads *eṇān* in **d**. Ppp. puts the verse next before our 12. The  
description of the meter by the Anukr. is unintelligible, since we have  
(12 + 14: 12 + 14) 52 syllables, or an *atijagatī;* perhaps *parājagatī*  
is a misreading for this.
