title = "१८ यथा देवा"

## Translation
18. As the gods thrust forth the Asuras, as Indra drove (*bādh*) the  
barbarians to lowest darkness, so do thou, O Kāma, thrust forth far from  
this world those who are my rivals.

## Notes
Ppp. has again *tamo ‘pabādhe*, but this time *dūram*. The "*jagatī*"  
meter is like that of vs. 17.
