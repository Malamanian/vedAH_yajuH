title = "०९ इन्द्राग्नी काम"

## Translation
9. Becoming, O Kāma, in alliance (*sarátham*) with Indra-and-Agni, may  
ye make my rivals to fall downward; of them, fallen to lowest  
darknesses, do thou, O Agni, burn along out the abodes.

## Notes
With **c, d** compare 4 **c, d** above. The first half-verse presents  
various anomalies: *sarátham* demands an instrumental case; we should  
expect rather a plural verb (but compare vi. 104. 3 **a, b**); and it  
should be accented after *hí*. Emending *indrāgnī́* to *índreṇa*, and  
reading *pādáyāthas*, would make everything right.
