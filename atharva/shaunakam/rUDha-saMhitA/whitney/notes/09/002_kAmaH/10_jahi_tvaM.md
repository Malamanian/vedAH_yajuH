## Translation
10. Slay thou, O Kāma, those that are my rivals; make them fall down to  
blind darknesses; be they all senseless (? *nírindriya*), sapless; let  
them not live any day soever.

## Notes
Ppp. combines *sapatnā ’ndhā* in **a-b**, combines and reads *nirindriyā  
’ravāḥ* in **c**, and has for **d** *yathā nu jīvāt katamac* ⌊-*maś*?⌋  
*cane ’ṣāṁ*.
