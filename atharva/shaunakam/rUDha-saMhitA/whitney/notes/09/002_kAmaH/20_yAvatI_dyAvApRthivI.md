## Translation
20. How great in width are heaven-and-earth; how far the waters flowed,  
how far fire—to them art thou etc. etc.

## Notes
With **a** is identical iv. 6. 2 **a**. Some saṁhitā-mss. read  
*sisyadúr* in **b** (O.s.m.R.). ⌊I find no note of R.⌋ The meter is  
described by the Anukr. in accordance with that of vs. 11.
