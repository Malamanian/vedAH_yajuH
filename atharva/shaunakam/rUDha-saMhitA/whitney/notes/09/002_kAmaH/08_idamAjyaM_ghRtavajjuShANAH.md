## Translation
8. Enjoying this sacrificial butter rich in ghee, do ye, with Kāma as  
chief (*-jyéṣṭha*), revel here, making for me freedom from rivals.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *ghṛtam id* in **a**, and *kṛṇvantu* in **c**. The verse is a  
perfectly good *virāṇnāmagāyatrī* but the Anukr. calls it an *ārcī  
pan̄kti*, as if it had 30 syllables.
