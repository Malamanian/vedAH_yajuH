## Translation
1. The eagle (*suparṇá*) was born first; of it thou wast the gall; then  
the Asura-woman, conquered by fight (*yúdh*), took shape as  
forest-trees.

## Notes
Ppp. reads at the end *vanaspatiḥ*, which is more in accordance with the  
usual construction of *rūpaṁ kṛ* (mid.) and the like. Ppp. has also  
*jighāṅsitā* for *yudhā jitā* in **c**. R. suggests the emendation: *tad  
āsurī* (instr.) *jighatsitaṁ rū-*, 'that, attempted to be eaten by the  
Āsurī, took on vegetable form': i.e. became a healing plant. The comm.  
still regards the indigo as addressed. He coolly explains *jitā* by its  
opposite, *jitavatī*. All our mss. have in **d** the absurd accent  
*cákre* (emended in the edition to *cakre*); SPP. reports the same only  
of two *pada*-mss.
