## Translation
2. O bow-string, bend about us; make thyself a stone; being hard, put  
very far away niggards \[and\] haters.

## Notes
A bow-string is, by Kāuś. 14. 13, one of the articles used in the rite.  
With **b** compare ii. 13. 4 **b**. Pāda **d** is RV. iii. 16. 5 **d**.  
'Niggard' is taken as conventional rendering of *árāti*. The comm. reads  
*vīḻus*, RV.-wise.
