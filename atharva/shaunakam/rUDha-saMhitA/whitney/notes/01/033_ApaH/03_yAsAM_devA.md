## Translation
 3. They of whom the gods in heaven make \[their\] draught (*bhakṣá*);  
they that come to be abundantly in the atmosphere; who, of beauteous  
color, etc. etc.

## Notes
Again TS. MS. have a different **c** (*yā́ḥ pṛthivī́m páyaso 'ndáanti  
śukrā́ḥ*). Our O. has at end of **c** *vírupāḥ* (as TS. MS. in 1 **c**).  
MP. substitutes *níviṣṭās* for *bhavantī* in **b**. The comm. renders  
*bhakṣám* by *upabhogyam*.
