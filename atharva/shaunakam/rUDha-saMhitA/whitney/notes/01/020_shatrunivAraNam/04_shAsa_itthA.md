## Translation
4. Verily a great ruler (*śāsá*) art thou, overpowerer of enemies,  
unsubdued, whose companion (*sákhi*) is not slain, is not scathed  
(*jyā*) at any time.

## Notes
This verse is the first in RV. x. 152, of which the remaining verses  
constitute the next hymn here; in Ppp. it occurs with them in ii., far  
separated from the matter which in our text precedes it. RV. and Ppp.  
both read for **b** *amitrakhādó ádbhutaḥ;* and RV. accents in **d**  
*jī́yate kádā*. The comm. paraphrases *śāsás* by *śāsako niyantā;* he  
takes *jīyáte* as from root *ji*, which is of course equally possible.
