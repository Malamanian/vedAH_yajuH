## Translation
3. Just here stretch thou on, as it were the two tips of the bow with  
the bow-string; let the lord of speech make fast (*ni-yam*); in me, in  
myself, be what is heard.

## Notes
Ppp. reads, in **a, b,** *tanū ubhey aratnī*. With the verse is to be  
compared RV. x. 166. 3. Prāt. i. 82 prescribes the *pada*-reading of  
*ā́rtnī॰iva*, and iv. 3 quotes *abhi vi tanu*. ⌊That is, apparently  
(**a**), 'Do \[for me\] some stretching \[or fastening\],' namely, of my  
sacred learning, as also in **c**.⌋
