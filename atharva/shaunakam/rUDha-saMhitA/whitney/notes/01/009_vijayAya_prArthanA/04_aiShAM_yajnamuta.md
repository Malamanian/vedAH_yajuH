## Translation
4. I take to myself their sacrifice and splendor (*várcas*), their  
abundance of wealth and their intents (*cittá*), O Agni; be his rivals  
inferior to him; to the highest firmament make this man ascend.

## Notes
The second half-verse is the same with 2 **c, d** above, and the  
translation makes the same emendation as there. Doubtless *vittā́ni*  
'acquisitions' should be read for *cittā́ni* in **b**; the comm. glosses  
with *buddhim*. The text is defaced in Ppp.; but in **d** can be read  
*uttama devā jyotiṣi dhatutama* (?) ⌊meaning, presumably, *dadhātana*⌋.
