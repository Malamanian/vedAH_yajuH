title = "०१ अस्मिन् वसु"

## Translation
1. In this man let the Vasus maintain good things (vásu)—Indra, Pūshan,  
Varuṇa, Mitra, Agni; him let the Ādityas and also the All-gods maintain  
in superior light.

## Notes
Ppp. substitutes *tvaṣṭā* for *pūṣā* in **b**, and *uta me devā* for  
*uttarasmin* in **d**. The Anukr. appears to sanction the metrical  
combination *ādityo 'ta* in **c**.
