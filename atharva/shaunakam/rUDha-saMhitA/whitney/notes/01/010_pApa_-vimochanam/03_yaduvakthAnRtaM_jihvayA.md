## Translation
3. In that thou hast spoken with the tongue untruth, much wrong—from the  
king of true ordinances (*-dhárman*), from Varuṇa, I release thee.

## Notes
⌊Read *yát tvám uváktha ánṛtam?*⌋ The comm. has in **a** the absurd  
reading *uvakta*, treating it as for *uvaktha*, which all the mss. give.
