## Translation
6. What in thine entrails, thy (two) groins (? gavīnī́), what in thy  
bladder has flowed together—so be thy urine released, out of thee, with  
a splash! all of it.

## Notes
The comm. reads in **b** (with two or three of SPP's mss., which follow  
him) *saṁśritam.* He explains the *gavīnyāu* as " two vessels (*nāḍī*)  
located in the two sides, affording access to the receptacles of urine."
