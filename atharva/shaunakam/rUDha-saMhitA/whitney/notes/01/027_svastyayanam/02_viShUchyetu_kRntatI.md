## Translation
2. Let the cutting one (*kṛt*) go asunder, she who bears as it were a  
club (*pínăka*); asunder \[go\] the mind of her that returns to life  
(*punarbhú*); unsuccessful \[are\] the malignant ones.

## Notes
Ppp. has no variants to cast light on this very obscure verse; it adds  
at the end *ape 'taṣ paripanthino 'po 'ghāyur arṣatu*. The comm. reads  
*punarbhavā* in **c**; he supplies "the array (*senā*) of our enemies"  
as the missing noun in the verse, and explains the epithet as  
"reassembling after dispersal." He paraphrases *kṛntatī́* with  
*chindatī*. ⌊SPP's *pada*-reading is *punaḥ॰bhúvāḥ*, against *Index  
Verborum,* p. 184 (corrected p. 383), and against *Skt. Gr.* §352 a,  
which should be corrected by p. 411 of Lanman's *Noun-Inflection.*⌋
