## Translation
3. She that hath cursed with cursing, that hath taken malignity as her  
root (? *mū́ra*), that hath seized on \[our\] young to take its sap—let  
her eat \[her own\] offspring.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The verse is repeated below as iv. 17. 3, and has there a parallel in  
Ppp. The comm. first takes *mū́ram* as for *mū́lam* (as rendered above),  
but adds an alternative explanation as *mūrchākaram*, adjective to  
*agham;* he has *ādade* in place of *-dhe*. *Jātám* is metrically an  
intrusion, but completes the sense.
