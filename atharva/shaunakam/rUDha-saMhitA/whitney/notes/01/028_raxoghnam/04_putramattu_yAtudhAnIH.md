## Translation
4. Let the sorceress eat \[her own\] son, sister, and daughter (?  
*naptī́*); then let the horrid-haired sorceresses mutually destroy  
(*vi-han*) one another; let the hags (*arāyī́*) be shattered asunder.

## Notes
The comm, explains *naptī* as *naptrī* or *pāutrasya* (*putrasya?*)  
*apatyarūpā saṁtati*. He reads *yātudhānī* (for *-nīs*) in **a**, and  
*atha* in **c**.  
  
    
The 7 hymns of this *anuvāka* ⌊5.⌋ have 28 verses, as determined by the  
quoted Anukr.: *pañcame 'ṣṭāu*.
