title = "०१ उप प्रागाद्"

## Translation
1. Hither hath come forth god Agni, demon-slayer, disease-expeller,  
burning away deceivers, sorcerers, *kimīdíns*.

## Notes
In our text, *upá* is a misprint for *úpa* (an accent-sign slipped out  
of place to the left). The comment on Prāt. iv. 3 quotes the first three  
words as exemplifying the disconnection of prefixes from a verb.
