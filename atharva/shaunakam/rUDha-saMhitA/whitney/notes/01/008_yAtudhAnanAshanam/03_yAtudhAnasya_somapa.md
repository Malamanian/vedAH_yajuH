## Translation
3. Of the sorcerer, O soma-drinker, slay the progeny and conduct \[him  
hither\]; of him, speaking out, make fall out (*nis-pat*) the upper eye  
and the lower.

## Notes
The comm. fills out the ellipsis in **b** by making it mean "conduct our  
progeny to obtain desired result"! and *stuvānasya* is *bhītyā  
tvadviṣayāṁ stutiṁ kurvataḥ.* Ppp. reads *nyastuvānasya*. SPP's text as  
well as ours gives *ní st-* (p. *níḥ: st-*); the *saṁhitā*-mss., as  
everywhere, are divided between that and *níḥ st-;* the latter is  
authorized by the silence of the Prātiśākhya ⌊see p. 426⌋ concerning the  
combination.
