## Translation
4. In the parrots, in the *ropaṇā́kās*, we put thy yellowness; likewise  
in the *hā́ridravas* we deposit thy yellowness.

## Notes
Not one of our mss. gives at the beginning the true reading *śúkesu*, as  
found in RV. i. 50. 12 ⌊and Ppp.⌋ (and TB. iii. 7. 6²²), but it is  
presented by the comm., and by three of SPP's authorities. RV. and TB.  
have *me* for *te* both times, and accent *hāridravéṣu.* The names are  
understood by the comm. as those of birds: *ropaṇākā* = *kāṣṭhaśuka*,  
apparently a kind of parrot, and *hāridrava* = *gopītanaka*, apparently  
a yellow water-wagtail. ⌊Ppp. has in **b** *prapaṇākāśa*.⌋
