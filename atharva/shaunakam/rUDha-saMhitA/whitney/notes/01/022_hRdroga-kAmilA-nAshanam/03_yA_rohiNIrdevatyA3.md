title = "०३ या रोहिणीर्देवत्या३"

## Translation
3. They that have the red one for divinity, and the kine that are  
red—form after form, vigor (*váyas*) after vigor, with them we enclose  
thee.

## Notes
The translation implies the easy emendation in **a** to  
*róhiṇīdevatyās*, in accordance with the universal use of *devatya*  
elsewhere. The 'red one' is perhaps the red star (or lunar asterism)  
Rohiṇī, our Aldebaran. Ppp. reads *rohiṇīr devatyā*, and in **b**  
*rohiṇīr uta;* in **d** it has *tena tvā.*
