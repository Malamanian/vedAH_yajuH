## Translation
2. With red colors we enclose thee, in order to length of life; that  
this man may be free from complaints (*-rápas*), also may become not  
yellow.

## Notes
Ppp. has a different second half-verse: *yathā tvam arapā 'so atho  
'hārito bhava*. The third pāda is iv. 13. 4 **d** (or RV. x. 137. 5  
**d**). The comm. explains *rapas* as = *pāpa*.
