title = "०३ यत् त"

## Translation
3. Whatever in thy self, in thy body, is frightful, or what in hair or  
in mien—all that do we smite away with \[our\] words; let god Savitar  
advance (*sūd*) thee.

## Notes
'God Savitar' or 'the heavenly impeller,' everywhere equivalent. Ppp.  
begins *yat tā "tman tanvā ghoram*, and has for **c, d** *tat te vidvāṅ  
upabādhayeṣāṁ pra tvā suvā savitā sāubhagāya*. The metrical description  
of the verse (11 + 11: 10 + 10 = 42) by the Anukr. is unusual and  
questionable.
