## Translation
2. Ye, O gods, who are the four region-guardians of the regions—do ye  
release us from the fetters (*pā́śa*) of perdition (*nírṛti*), from every  
distress (*áṅhas*).

## Notes
The comm. reads *stana* for *sthana* in **b**. The Anukr. does not note  
**b** as metrically deficient, doubtless making the harsh resolution  
*ca-tu-ā́-ro*.
