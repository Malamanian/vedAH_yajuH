title = "०२ विष्वञ्चो अस्मच्छरवः"

## Translation
2. Dispersing from us let the shafts fly, those that are hurled and that  
are to be hurled; ye divine arrows of men (*manuṣyà-*), pierce my  
enemies.

## Notes
The comm. inserts an "and" in **c**: "divine and human arrows"; this is  
possible, but opposed by the accent. Ppp. has for **c, d**: *devā  
manuṣyā ṛṣayo 'mitrān no vi viddhatu;* the comm. also reads *vidhyatu*.
