## Translation
3. What the (two) quaking firmaments (*ródasī*)—and the earth—fashioned  
out, that at present is always wet, like the streams of the ocean.

## Notes
In **b** the translation implies emendation to *átakṣatām*, as favored  
by the Ppp. reading *nara-cakṣatām;* there remains the anomaly of  
letting the verb agree with *ródasī*  (Ppp. has *rodhasī*); perhaps we  
ought to read *bhū́mes* 'out of the earth.' The comm., with a disregard  
of the accent which is habitual with him, takes *ródasī* and its epithet  
as vocatives, and then supplies *dyāus*, vocative ⌊JAOS. xi. 66⌋‎, in  
**b** to help make a dual subject for the verb! For **d** Ppp. has  
*vidurassevavartasī.* ⌊For **c**, of. śB. vi. 6. 33.⌋‎
