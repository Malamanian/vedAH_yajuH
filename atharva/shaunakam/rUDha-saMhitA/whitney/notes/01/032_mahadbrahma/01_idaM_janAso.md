## Translation
1. Now, ye people, take knowledge; he will speak a great mystery (?  
*bráhman*); that is not on earth nor in the sky whereby the plants  
breathe.

## Notes
With **a, b** is to be compared the very similar line xx. 127. 1 **a,  
b**; *idáṁ janā úpa śruta nārāśaṅsá staviṣyate;* which makes it probable  
that the ungrammatical *vidátha* means *vidata* or *vedatha* (accent is  
unmotived), and suggests also *vadiṣyate,* passive; the former seems  
confounded with the noun *vidátha,* of which *vidáthe,* or, as Ppp.  
reads, *vidátham,* would make fairly good sense: 'will now be spoken at  
(or to) the council.' Ppp. reads *yatas* for *yena* in **d**. ⌊For  
prandnti, see Prāt. iv. 57.⌋
