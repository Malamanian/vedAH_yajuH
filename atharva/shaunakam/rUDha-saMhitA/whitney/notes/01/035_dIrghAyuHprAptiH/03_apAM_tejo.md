## Translation
3. The waters' brilliancy, light, force, and strength, also the heroic  
powers (*vīryà*) of the forest trees, do we maintain in him, as in Indra  
Indra's powers (*indriyá*); this gold shall he, being capable, bear.

## Notes
The comm. explains *dákṣamāṇa* in **d** by *vardhamāna.* Omission of the  
superfluous *indriyā́ṇi* in **c** would rectify the meter; the  
*pada*-text marks the division wrongly before *asmín* instead of after  
it; ⌊the Anukr. likewise reckons *asmín* to **d** and describes the pāda  
as one of 14 syllables!⌋.
