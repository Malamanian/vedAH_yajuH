## Translation
1. What gold the descendants of Dakṣa, well-willing, bound on for  
śatānīka, that I bind for thee, in order to life (*ā́yus*), splendor,  
strength, to length of life for a hundred autumns.

## Notes
It would rectify the meter and improve the sense (considering that  
*dīrghāyutvá* follows) to omit *ā́yuse* in **c**; the Anukr. notes the  
redundancy of the pāda (14 syllables). VS. (xxxiv. 52) has the first  
half-verse, with a different second half; and so has a RV. khila to RV.  
x. 128 (9, Aufrecht, p. 685). The Kāuś. speaks of *yugmakṛṣṇala* as the  
amulet: probably a pair of beads of gold like *kṛṣṇala* berries. The  
comm. quotes AB. viii. 21. 5 for śatānīka.
