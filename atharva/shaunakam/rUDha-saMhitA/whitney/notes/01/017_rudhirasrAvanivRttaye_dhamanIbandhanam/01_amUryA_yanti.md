## Translation
1. Yon women (*yoṣít*) that go, veins with red garments, like  
brotherless sisters (*jāmí*)—let them stop (*sthā*), with their splendor  
smitten.

## Notes
Ppp. makes *yoṣitas* and *jāmayas* change places, and has *sarvās*  
(better) for *hirās* in **b**. The comm. takes *yoṣítas* as gen. sing.,  
and hence naturally understands *rajovahananāḍyas* to be meant in the  
verse; he renders *hirās* by *sirās;* and he explains that brotherless  
sisters *pitṛkule saṁtānakarmaṇe piṇḍadānāya ca tiṣṭhanti*. The Anukr.  
refuses to sanction the contraction *-tare 'va* in **c**.
