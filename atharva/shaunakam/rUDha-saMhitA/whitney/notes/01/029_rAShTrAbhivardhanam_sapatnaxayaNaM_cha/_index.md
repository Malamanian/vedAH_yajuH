## Comment
Found (except vs. 4) in Pāipp. i., and (with the same exception, in RV., chiefly x. 174 ⌊:namely, AV. verses 1, 2, 3, 6 correspond respectively with RV. verses 1, 2, 3, 5. See Oldenberg, Die Hymnen des RV., i. 243⌋. Kāuś. uses the hymn in the ceremony of restoration of a king, with preparing and binding on an amulet made of the rim of a chariot-wheel (16. 29: the comm. says, vss. 1-4); the last two verses are specifically prescribed for the binding on. The comm. quotes the hymn as employed by the Nakṣatra Kalpa (19) in a mahāśānti called māhendrī.
