## Translation
4. The over-rolling, overcoming, rival-destroying amulet be bound upon  
me unto royalty, unto the perishing (*parābhū́*) of rivals.

## Notes
The verse is wanting in both RV. and Ppp. Its excision, with the  
following verse  (which, however, Ppp. has), would leave the hymn of  
normal length, and composed of four out of the five verses of RV. x. 174  
⌊, of the fourth of which the excision is called for⌋.
