## Translation
4. Of the waters, having mastery of desirable things, ruling over human  
beings (*carṣaṇí*), I ask a remedy.

## Notes
The verse follows in RV. our 6. 1. It is found, without variants, in TB.  
(ii. 5. 8⁵) and TA. (iv. 42. 4); but MS. (iv. 9. 27) has a corrupt third  
pāda, with much discordance among the mss., and adds a fourth.
