## Translation
3. Child of the height, be homage to thee; homage we pay to thy missile  
(*hetí*) and heat (*tápus*); we know thy highest abode (*dhā́man*) that  
is in secret; thou art set as navel within the \[cloud-\]ocean.

## Notes
⌊The *te* in **b** is superfluous.⌋ Ppp. rectifies the meter of **a** by  
omitting *eva;* its other pādas are more or less corrupt: *namas te hete  
tipuṣyāi* in **b** (which ends there); *gandharvo nāma par-* in **c**;  
*nihitāsa nābhiḥ* at the end. The comm. takes *tápus* as adjective. The  
verse is scanned by the Anukr. as 12 + 12: 11 + 11 = 46 syllables.
