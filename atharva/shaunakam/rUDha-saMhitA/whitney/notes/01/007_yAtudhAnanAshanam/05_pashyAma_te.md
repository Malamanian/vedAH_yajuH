title = "०५ पश्याम ते"

## Translation
5. We would fain see thy heroism (*vīryà*), O Jātavedas; proclaim to   
us the sorcerers, O men-watcher; let them all, burnt about by thee in  
front, come to this place, proclaiming themselves.

## Notes
Ppp. reads in **a** *vīryā;* in **c**, *-taptaṣ;* in **d**, *yāntu*. The  
change of meter makes the verse suspicious as original part of the hymn;  
but the presence of all the verses in Ppp., in the same order, puts the  
intrusion, if it be one, far back.
