## Translation
6. Take hold, O Jātavedas; thou wast born for our purpose; becoming our  
messenger, O Agni, make the sorcerers cry out.

## Notes
The comm. this time, utterly regardless of the obvious connection with  
*vi lapantu* in 2 **d**, and of the general sense of the hymn, glosses  
*vi lāpaya* only with *vināśaya*. Ppp. has a totally different text: *ā  
rabhasva brāhmaṇā jātavedo hṛdi kāmāya randhaya: dūto na agnir ut tiṣṭha  
yātudhānān ihā "naya.*
