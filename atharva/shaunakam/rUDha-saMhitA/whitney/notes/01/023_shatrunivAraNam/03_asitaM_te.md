## Translation
3. Dusky is thy hiding-place, dusky thy station (*āsthā́na*); dusky art  
thou, O herb; make the speckled disappear from hence.

## Notes
TB. has the easier reading *niláyanam* in **a**. The comm. again gives  
*pṛthak* in **d**; he holds that the plant here addressed is the indigo  
(*nīlī*).
