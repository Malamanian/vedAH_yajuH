title = "०३ ये नदीनां"

## Translation
 3. What fountains of the streams flow together, ever unexhausted, with  
all those confluences we make riches (*dhána*) flow together for me.

## Notes
Ppp. has in **a, b** *ye nadībhyas saṁsravanty ucchāmas saram akṣikā.*  
The comm. gives the verse twice, each time with a separate explanation.
