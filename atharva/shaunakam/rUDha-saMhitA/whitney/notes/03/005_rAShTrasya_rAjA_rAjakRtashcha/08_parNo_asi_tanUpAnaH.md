## Translation
8. *Parṇá* art thou, body-protecting; a hero, from the same womb  
(*yóni*) with me a hero; with the year's brilliancy—therewith I bind  
thee on, O amulet.

## Notes
Wanting in Ppp. The second pāda is damaged, in meter and in sense, by  
the apparently intruded *vīrás.*  
  
The *anuvāka* ⌊1.⌋ ends here, having 5 hymns and 33 verses; the old  
Anukr. says: *triṅśannimittāḥ ṣaḍṛceṣu* (mss. *-ḍarc-*) *kāryās tisraḥ.*
