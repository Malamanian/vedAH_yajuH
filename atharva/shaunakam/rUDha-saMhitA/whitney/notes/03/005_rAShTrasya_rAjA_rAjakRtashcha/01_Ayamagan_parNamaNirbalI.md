## Translation
1. Hither hath come this *parṇá*-amulet, strong, by strength  
slaughtering our rivals; force of the gods, milk of the herbs, let it  
quicken me with splendor unremittingly.

## Notes
Ppp. has for **d** *mayi rāṣṭraṁ jinvatv aprayucchan.* *Áprayāvan* in  
**d**, which is read by all the mss. (hence by both editions) and the  
comm., is unquestionably to be emended (as suggested by BR., v. 1015) to  
*-yāvam* ⌊Skt. Gram.² §995 b, root *yu;* cf. *yuch*⌋; the word is quoted  
in the Prāt. text (iv. 56), but not in a way to determine its form  
(*aprayāvādi-*). As the later verses show, *parṇa* is to be understood  
here as the tree of that name (*Butea frondosa:* comm. *palāśavṛkṣa*).  
The comm. raises no objection to *áprayāvan*, and explains it as either  
*māṁ vihāyā ’napagantā san* (with irregular exchange of case-forms), or  
else *aprayātar*, i.e. *sarvadā dhāryamāṇa.*
