## Translation
3. The dear amulet which the gods deposited hidden in the  
forest-tree—that let the gods give to us to wear, together with length  
of life (*ā́yus*).

## Notes
Ppp. has for **b** *vājiṁ devāḥ priyaṁ nidhim*, and its second  
half-verse is *taṁ ma indras sahā ”yuṣā maṇiṁ dadātu bhartave.*
