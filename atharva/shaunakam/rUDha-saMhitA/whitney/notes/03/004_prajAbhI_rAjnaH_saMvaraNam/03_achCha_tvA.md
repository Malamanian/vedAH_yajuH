## Translation
3. Unto thee let thy fellows come, calling \[thee\]; Agni shall go along  
as speedy messenger; let the wives, the sons, be well-willing; thou,  
formidable, shalt see arrive (*prati-paś*) much tribute.

## Notes
Ppp. has in **a, b** *yantu bhuvanasya jālā ’gnir dūto ‘va jarase  
dadhāti*, and combines in **c** *jāyāṣ p-*. The comm. finds in **b** an  
incomplete simile: "thy messenger, unassailable like fire, shall" etc.
