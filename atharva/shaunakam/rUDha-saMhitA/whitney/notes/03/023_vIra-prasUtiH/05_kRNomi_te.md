## Translation
5. I perform for thee the \[ceremony\] of Prajāpati; let a fœtus come to  
thy womb; acquire thou a son, O woman, who shall be weal for thee; weal  
also for him do thou become.

## Notes
The accent of *bháva* at the end is anomalous. HGS. (as above) has the  
first half-verse ⌊and MP., at i. 13. i, concordantly⌋; it reads *karomi*  
at the beginning, and in **b** puts *yonim* after *garbhas;* this latter  
Ppp. does also. The comm. understands *prājāpatyam* as above translated;  
other renderings are possible ("das Zeugungswerk," Weber;  
"Zeugungsfähigkeit," Zimmer). The metrical definition of the verse (8 +  
8: 8 + 5 + 8 = 37) is not good save mechanically.
