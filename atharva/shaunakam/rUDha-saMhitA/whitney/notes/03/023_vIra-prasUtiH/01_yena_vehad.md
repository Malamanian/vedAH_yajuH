title = "०१ येन वेहद्"

## Translation
1. By what thou hast become barren (*vehát*), that we make disappear  
from thee; that now we set down elsewhere, far away from (*ápa*) thee.

## Notes
*Vehát* is perhaps more strictly 'liable to abort'; the comm. gives the  
word here either sense. Ppp. is defective, giving only the initial words  
of vss. 1 and 2.
