title = "०७ अपवासे नक्षत्राणामपवास"

## Translation
7. In the fading-out of the asterisms, in the fading-out of the dawns  
also, from us \[fade\] out all that is of evil nature, fade out  
(*apa-vas*) the *kṣetriyá.*

## Notes
Ppp. has *tato ’ṣasām* at end of **b**, and in **c** *āmayat* for  
*durbhūtam.* Emendation of *asmát* in **c** to *asmāt* (as suggested by  
Weber) would notably improve the sense. The second pāda has a syllable  
too many, unless we make the double combination *vāsó ’ṣásām.*
