title = "०६ इहैव स्तं"

## Translation
6. Be ye just here, O breath-and-expiration; go ye not away from here;  
carry his body, his limbs, unto old age again.

## Notes
At the end of **b**, the comm. reads *javam* (= *śīghram, akāle*)  
instead of *yuvám*, and two or three of SPP's mss., as often, follow  
him.
