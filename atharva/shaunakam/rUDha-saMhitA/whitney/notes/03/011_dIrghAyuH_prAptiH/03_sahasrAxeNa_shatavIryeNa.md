## Translation
3. With an oblation having a thousand eyes, a hundred heroisms, a  
hundred life-times, have I taken him, in order that Indra may lead him  
unto autumns, across to the further shore of all difficulty (*duritá*).

## Notes
RV. has in **a** *śatáśāradena* for *śatávīryeṇa*, and makes much better  
sense of **c, d** by reading *śatám* for *índras*, and *índras* for  
*áti* (it also has *imám* for *enam*).
