## Translation
8. Old age hath curbed (*abhi-dhā*) thee, as it were a cow, an ox, with  
a rope; the death that curbed thee, when born, with easy fetter—that  
Brihaspati released for thee, with the (two) hands of truth.

## Notes
The verb-forms represent the noun *abhidhā́nī* 'halter, or bridle, or  
rope for confining and guiding.' ⌊A case of "reflected meaning":  
discussed, Lanman, *Transactions of the Am. Philol. Association*, vol.  
xxvi, p. xiii (1894). Cf. note to iv. 18. 1.⌋ As in many other cases,  
the comm. renders the aorist *ahita* (for *adhita*) as an imperative,  
*baddhaṁ karotu*. On account of *jāyamānam* in **d** (virtually 'at thy  
birth') Weber entitles the hymn "on occasion of difficult parturition,"  
which is plainly wrong. Perhaps it is for the same reason that the comm.  
regards it as relating to a child, or to a person diseased from improper  
copulation. In our text, at the beginning, read *abhí* (an accent-sign  
lost under *a-*). There is no *bṛhatī* element in the verse.
