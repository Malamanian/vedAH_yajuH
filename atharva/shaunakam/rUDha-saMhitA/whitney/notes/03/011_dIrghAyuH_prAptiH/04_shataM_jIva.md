## Translation
4. Live thou increasing a hundred autumns, a hundred winters, and a  
hundred springs; a hundred to thee \[may\] Indra, Agni, Savitar,  
Brihaspati \[give\]; with an oblation of a hundred life-times have I  
taken him.

## Notes
Our text, in the second half-verse, ingeniously defaces the better meter  
and sense given by RV., which reads *indrāgnī́* for *ta índro agníḥ* in  
**c**, and ends with *havíṣe ’mám púnar duḥ.* The verse is fairly  
correctly defined by the Anukr., its **c** having 14 syllables  
(*śakarī*), and making the whole number 47 syllables (*jagatī* less 1).
