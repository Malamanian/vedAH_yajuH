title = "०४ यः सहमानश्चरसि"

## Translation
4. Thou that goest about overpowering, like a bull that has  
overpowered—with thee here, O *aśvatthá*, may we overpower our rivals.

## Notes
Ppp. reads in **a** *carati*, as does also the comm., followed by two or  
three of SPP's mss. Ppp. further combines in **b** *sāsahānāi ’va ṛṣ-*,  
and ends **d** with *saṁviṣīvahi.* ⌊The *saṁhitā*-mss. all combine *iva  
ṛṣ-* in **b**; see note to Prat. iii. 46.⌋
