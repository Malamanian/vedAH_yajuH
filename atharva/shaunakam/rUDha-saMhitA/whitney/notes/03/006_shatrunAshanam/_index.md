## Comment
A very acceptable emendation would be pári jātás, since pári is plainly accessory to the ablative puṁsás, as ádhi to khadirā́t in b (cf. ásatas pári jajñiré, x. 7. 25). Ppp. retains the initial a of aśvatthas, and begins d with yāṅś cā ’ham. The aśvattha begins as a parasite, usually on the śamī (fem.), this time from the hard khadira (masc).
