title = "०३ यो ददाति"

## Translation
3. Let earth accept thee, this great atmosphere; let me not, having  
accepted, be parted with breath, nor with self, nor with progeny.

## Notes
Addressed to the thing accepted (*he deya dravya*, comm.). The Anukr.  
regards pāda **c** as ending with *ātmánā*, and the *pada*-text divides  
at the same place.
