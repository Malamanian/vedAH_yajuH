title = "१३ इन्द्रपुत्रे सोमपुत्रे"

## Translation
13. Thou whose son is Indra, whose son is Soma, daughter art thou of  
Prajāpati; fulfil thou our desires; accept our oblation.

## Notes
Wanting in Ppp., as above noted.  
  
The second *anuvāka* contains 5 hymns, 40 verses; and the quotation from  
the old Anukr. is simply *daśa*.
