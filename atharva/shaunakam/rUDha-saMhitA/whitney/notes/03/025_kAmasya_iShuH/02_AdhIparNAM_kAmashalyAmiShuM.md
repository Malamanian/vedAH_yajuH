## Translation
2. The arrow feathered with longing (*ādhī́*), tipped with love, necked  
with resolve (? *saṁkalpá-*)—having made that well-straightened, let  
love pierce thee in the heart.

## Notes
According to the comm., *ādhī́* means *mānasī pīḍā; śalyam* is *bāṇāgre  
protam āyasam; kulmalam* is *dāruśalyayoḥ saṁśleṣadravyam* ⌊thing (like  
a ferrule?) to fasten the tip to the shaft⌋. Our P.M.W. read *tā́* for  
*tā́m* at beginning of **c**. Pāda **c** requires the harsh resolution  
*ta-ā́m*.
