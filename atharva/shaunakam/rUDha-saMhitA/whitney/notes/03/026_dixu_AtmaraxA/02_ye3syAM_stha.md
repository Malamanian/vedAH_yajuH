## Translation
2. Ye gods that are in this southern quarter, impetuous (? *aviṣyú*) by  
name—of you there the arrows are love (*kā́ma*): do ye be etc. etc.

## Notes
The comm. reads *avasyavas* instead of *aviṣyavas*. In TS., the name in  
this quarter is "smearers" (*nilimpa*), and the arrows are "the Fathers,  
sea (*ságara*)."
