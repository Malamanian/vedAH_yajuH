## Translation
7. They who move on along the sky, the earth, the atmosphere, along the  
lightning; who are within the quarters, who within the wind—to those  
fires be this oblation made.

## Notes
Our P.M.W. read in **b** *vīdyútam*, and P.M.W.I, end the pāda with  
*-carati*. SPP. regards the exposition of the comm. as implying that the  
latter takes *anu* in **b** as an independent word: *ánu saṁc-*. In the  
definition of the Anukr., *virāj* appears to be used as meaning 'a pāda  
of 10 syllables' (11 + 10: 10 + 11 = 42). ⌊Read *yé ca vā́te?*⌋  
  
The three remaining verses of the hymn are plainly independent of what  
precedes, concerning themselves directly with the appeasement of an  
ill-omened fire; but the combination of the two parts is an old one,  
being found also in Ppp. The ejection of the evidently patched-together  
vs. 6 would reduce the first part ⌊vss. 1-7⌋ to the norm of this book.
