## Translation
3. He who, a god, goes in the same chariot with Indra, he that belongs  
to all men (*vāiśvānará*) and to all gods (?), whom, very powerful in  
fights, I call loudly on—to those fires be this oblation made.

## Notes
MS. and K. have for **a** *yéné ’ndrasya ráthaṁ sambabhūvúr*, and Ppp.  
partly agrees with them, reading *ye ’ndreṇa sarathaṁ saṁbabhūva*. In  
**b**, the translation ventures to follow Ppp's reading *viśvadevyas*  
instead of *-dāvyàs*, because of its so obvious preferability in the  
connection; *-dāvyas* is quite in place in vs. 9, and may perhaps have  
blundered from there into this verse; but MS. and K. have *-dāvyàs;*  
they further exchange the places of our 3 **c** and 4 **c**. Pāda **b**  
is a very poor *triṣṭubh*, though capable of being read into 11  
syllables ⌊read *utá vā?*⌋.
