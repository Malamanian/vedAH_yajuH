## Translation
2. Without claspers they held fast (*dhāraya*); that was so done by  
Manu; I make the *víṣkandha* impotent, like a castrater of bulls.

## Notes
Ppp. begins with *aśleṣamāṇo ‘dh-;* some of the mss. (including our O.)  
also give *aśleṣmā́ṇas*, and it is the reading of the comm.; he gives two  
different and equally artificial explanations; and, what is surprising  
even in him, three diverse ones of *vádhri*, without the least regard to  
the connection; one of the three is the right one. Ppp. adds *ca* after  
*vadhri* in **c**. Weber plausibly conjectures a method of tight tying  
to be the subject of the verse; castration is sometimes effected in that  
way.
