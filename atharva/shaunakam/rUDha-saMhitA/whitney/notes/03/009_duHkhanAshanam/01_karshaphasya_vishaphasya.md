## Translation
1. Of the *karśápha*, of the *viśaphá*, heaven \[is\] father, earth  
mother: as, O gods, ye have inflicted (*abhi-kṛ*), so do ye remove  
(*apa-kṛ*) again.

## Notes
The whole hymn contains much that is obscure and difficult, and the  
comm. gives no real help anywhere, being as much reduced to guessing as  
we are. Ppp. begins with *karṣabhasya viṣabhyasya*, which rather favors  
Weber's opinion, that the *apha* of the two names is a suffix, related  
with *abha;* probably two varieties of *viṣkandha* are intended, though  
none such are mentioned in the later medicine. The comm. finds *śapha*  
'hoof' in both: one = *kṛśaśaphasya* (*vyāghrādeḥ*), the other either  
*vigataśaphasya* or *vispaṣṭaśaphasya.* SPP. reads in **b** *dyāúḥ p-,*  
which is doubtless preferable to our *dyāúṣ p-;* it is read by the  
majority of his mss. and by part of ours (H.I.K.); Ppp. also has it.  
Ppp. further omits *abhi* in **c**, and reads *api* for *apa* in **d**.
