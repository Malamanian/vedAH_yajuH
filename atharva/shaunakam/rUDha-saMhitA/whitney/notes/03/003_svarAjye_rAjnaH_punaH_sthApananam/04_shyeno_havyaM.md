## Translation
4. Let the falcon lead hither from far (*pára*) the one to be called,  
living exiled in others' territory (*kṣétra*); let the (two) Aśvins make  
the road for thee easy to go; settle together about this man, ye his  
fellows.

## Notes
The translation follows both previous translators, and the comm. (=  
*hvātavyam*), in implying *hávyam* in **a** instead of *havyám*  
'oblation'; yet Ppp. reads *havis*, which supports *havyám.* The comm.,  
with several of SPP's mss., has *avaruddham* in **b**; for ⌊the  
technical⌋ *aparuddhaś caran* (and *ava-gam*, 6 **d**) compare  
especially PB. xii. 12. 6.
