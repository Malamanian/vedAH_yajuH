## Translation
2. Indra, the inspired one, however far away, let the ruddy ones set in  
motion hither (*ā-cyāvaya-*) in order to friendship, when the gods  
venture (?) for him a *gāyatrī́*, a *bṛhatī́*, a song (*arká*), with the  
*sāutrāmaṇī́* (ceremony).

## Notes
This verse is nearly as obscure as the preceding, and probably as  
hopelessly corrupt. The "ruddy ones" in **a** are, according to the  
comm., priests (*ṛtvij*); Weber understands "horses," Ludwig "somas."  
The comm. takes *dádhṛṣanta* in **d** first from root *dhṛ* (! =  
*adhārayan*), then apparently from *dhṛṣ* (*pūrvaṁ visrastāvayavant  
indram punaḥ sarvāvayavopetam akurvan*, citing TS. v. 6. 3⁴); Ppp. has  
*dadṛśanta;* perhaps *dadṛhanta* might be made to yield the best sense;  
restoration of the augment would fill out the deficient meter, which the  
Anukr. fails to remark. R. conjectures "made firm for him the mighty  
*gāyatrī* as bolt." About half the mss. (including our Bp.E.I.H.K.)  
accent in **b** *sakhyā̀ya;* the same uncertainty as to this word appears  
elsewhere.
