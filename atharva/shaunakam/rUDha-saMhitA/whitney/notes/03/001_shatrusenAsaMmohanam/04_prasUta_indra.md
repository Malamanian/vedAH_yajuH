## Translation
4. Impelled, O Indra, forwards (? *pravátā*) by thy (two) bays—let thy  
thunderbolt go forth, slaughtering (*pra-mṛ*) the foes; smite the  
on-coming, the following, the fleeing (*párāñc*); scatter their actual  
intent.

## Notes
The verse is RV. iii. 30. 6; which, however, reads at the beginning *prá  
sū́ te* (as does also the comm.), accents in **c** *pratīcó anūcáḥ* (and  
the comm. claims the same for our text), and has for **d** *víśvaṁ  
satyáṁ kṛṇuhi viṣṭám astu*, which is even more unintelligible than our  
text. Weber proposes *viṣvaksatyám* as a compound, "turning itself in  
every direction"; this, however, makes nothing out of *-satyam.* Ludwig  
translates "fulfil their design in all \[both\] directions," which is  
not very clear. Ppp. reads *viśvaṁ viṣṭaṁ kṛṇuhi satyam eṣām;* also  
quite obscure. The comm. takes *satyam* as "established, settled," and  
*viṣvak kṛṇuhi* as "scatter, unsettle, make uncertain." One would like  
to take *viṣvak-* as something like 'contrariwise,' with the general  
sense "turn their plans against themselves." Ppp. has further *nūaḥ* for  
*anūcas* in **c**.
