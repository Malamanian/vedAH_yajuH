## Translation
2. Up I sharpen the royalty of them, up their force, heroism, strength;  
I hew \[off\] the arms of the foes with this oblation.

## Notes
The translation implies emendation of the *syāmi* of all the mss. and of  
both editions to *śyāmi;* it is obviously called for (suggested first by  
the Pet. Lex.), and the comm., reads *śyāmi;* Ppp. probably intends it  
by *paśyāmi*. The latter half-verse is found again below as vi. 65. 2  
**c, d**; its text is confused here in Ppp. (*vṛścāmi śatrūṇāṁ bāhū sam  
aśvām aśvān aham*). The Anukr. ignores the redundant syllable in **a**.
