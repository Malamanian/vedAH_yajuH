title = "०४ तीक्ष्णीयांसः परशोरग्नेस्तीक्ष्णतरा"

## Translation
4. Sharper than an ax, also sharper than fire, sharper than Indra's  
thunderbolt—\[they\] of whom I am the household priest.

## Notes
Emendation to *indravajrā́t* would rectify the meter of **c**; but the  
Anukr. apparently accepts the redundancy there as balancing the  
deficiency in **a**.
