## Translation
5. The waters \[are\] excellent; the waters verily were ghee; these  
waters verily bear Agni-and-Soma; may the strong (*tīvrá*) satisfying  
savor (*rása*) of the honey-mixed (*-pṛc*) come to me along with breath,  
with splendor.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
TS. reads *āsus* for *āsan* at end of **a**, and both TS. and MS., as  
also the comm., have *gan* at the end (MS.p. *agan*). MS. combines  
differently the material of our vss. 5 and 6: first our 6 **a, b** with  
5 **c, d**, then our 5 **a, b** with 6 **c, d**; and for our 5 **a** it  
reads *ā́po devī́r ghṛtaminvā́ u ā́pas.* This last seems also to be intended  
by Ppp., with its *āpo devīr ghṛtam itāpāhus;* and it has *ityā* instead  
of *it tās* at end of **b**, and combines *-gamā mā* in **c-d**. The  
comm. renders *madhupṛcām* by *madhunā rasena sampṛktānām;* the  
description in pāda **c** almost makes us fancy some kind of mineral  
water to be had in view.
