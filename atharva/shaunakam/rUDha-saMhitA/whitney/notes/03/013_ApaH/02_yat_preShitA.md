## Translation
2. When, sent forth by Varuna, ye thereupon (*ā́t*) quickly skipped  
(*valg*) together, then Indra obtained (*āp*) you as ye went; therefore  
are ye waters (*ā́p*) afterward.

## Notes
TS. and MS. have in **d** *ā́pas* (nomin.), and this is obviously the  
true reading, and assumed in the translation; both editions follow the  
mss. (except our Op.) in giving *āpas.* MS. begins the verse with  
*samprácyutās;* for *ā́t* in **b** MS. has *yát* and TS. *tā́s.* In **d**,  
Ppp. elides the *a* of *anu;* TS. leaves *sthana* unlingualized. The  
comm. reads instead *stana.*
