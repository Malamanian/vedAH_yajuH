## Translation
7. This, O waters, \[is\] your heart, this your young (*vatsá*), ye  
righteous ones; come thus hither, ye mighty ones, where I now make you  
enter.

## Notes
The preceding verses have been simple laudation of the waters; this  
appended one (which is found neither in Ppp. nor in the other texts)  
adds a practical application, and is the sole foundation of the  
employment of the hymn by Kāuś. With the first pāda a piece of gold is  
buried in the desired channel; with **b** a prepared frog is fastened  
there; with **c** the frog is covered with a water-plant; with **d**  
water is conducted in.
