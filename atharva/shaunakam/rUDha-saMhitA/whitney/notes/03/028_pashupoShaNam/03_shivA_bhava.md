title = "०३ शिवा भव"

## Translation
3. Be thou propitious to men (*púruṣa*), propitious to kine, to horses,  
propitious to all this field (*kṣétra*); be propitious to us here.

## Notes
'Field' seems taken here in a general sense, and might be rendered  
'farm.' The Anukr. takes no notice of the irregularities in **c** and  
**d**, probably because they balance each other.
