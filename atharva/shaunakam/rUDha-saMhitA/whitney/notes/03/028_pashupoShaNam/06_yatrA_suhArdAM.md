title = "०६ यत्रा सुहार्दां"

## Translation
6. Where is the world of the good-hearted, of the well-doing, where of  
them that offer the fire-offering (*agnihotrá-*)—into that world hath  
the twinning one come into being; let her not injure our men and cattle.

## Notes
The omission of the superfluous *yátra* in **b** would rectify the  
meter. The Anukr. should say *āstārapan̄kti* instead of *prastāra-;* its  
*virāj* means here a pāda of 10 syllables.
