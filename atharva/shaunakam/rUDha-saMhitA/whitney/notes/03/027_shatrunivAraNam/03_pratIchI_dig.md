title = "०३ प्रतीची दिग्"

## Translation
3. Western quarter; Varuna overlord; the adder (*pṛ́dāku*) defender; food  
the arrows: homage to those etc. etc.

## Notes
The comm. explains *pṛdākus* as *kutsitaśabdakārī:* an absurd fancy. TS.  
and MS. give here Soma as overlord, and the constrictor as defender.
