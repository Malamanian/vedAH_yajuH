## Translation
6. Upward quarter; Brihaspati overlord; the white (*śvitrá*) \[serpent\]  
defender; rain the arrows: homage to those etc. etc.

## Notes
Ppp. has here the thunderbolt (*aśani*) for arrows. Part of the mss.  
(including our E.O.K.Kp.) give *citrá* instead of *śvitrá* as name of  
the serpent; TS. reads *śvitrá*, but MS. (probably by a misreading)  
*citrá*. TS. calls the quarter *bṛhadī́* 'great.' TS. (after the manner  
of the AV. mss.) leaves out the repeated part of the imprecation in the  
intermediate verses (2-5); MS. gives it in full every time. ⌊Reference  
to this vs. as made by Bergaigne, *Rel. véd.* iii. 12 (cf. Baunack, KZ.  
xxxv. 527), is hardly apt.⌋
