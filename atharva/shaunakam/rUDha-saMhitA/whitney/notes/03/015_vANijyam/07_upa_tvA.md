## Translation
 7. Unto thee with homage do we, O priest Vāiśvānara ('for all men'),  
give praise; do thou watch over our progeny, our selves, our kine, our  
breaths.

## Notes
Two of our *pada*-mss. (Bp.Kp.; also D.p.m.?) divide *vāiśvānaraḥ:*  
*tumaḥ* in **b**; P.M.W. give *sám* for *sá* at beginning of **c**. This  
verse and the next seem to be additions to the original hymn. ⌊Under  
*stu*, BR. and *Index Verborum* join *úpa* with *stu;* correct *Index*  
under *úpa* accordingly.⌋
