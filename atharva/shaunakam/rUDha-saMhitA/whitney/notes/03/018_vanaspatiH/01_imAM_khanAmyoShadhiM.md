## Translation
1. I dig this herb, of plants the strongest, with which one drives off  
(*bādh*) her rival; with which one wins completely (*sam-vid*) her  
husband.

## Notes
RV. reads in **b** the accus. *vīrúdham*. For **d**, Ppp. gives *kṛṇute  
kevalaṁ patim*. The comm. (with our Op.) has *oṣadhīm* in **a**; he  
understands throughout the herb in question to be the *pāṭhā* (cf. ii.  
27. 4), though Kāuś. and the Anukr. speak only of *bāṇāparṇī* 'arrow  
leaf' (not identified).
