title = "०१ सहृदयं सांमनस्यमविद्वेषं"

## Translation
1. Like-heartedness, like-mindedness, non-hostility do I make for you;  
do ye show affection (*hary*) the one toward the other, as the  
inviolable \[cow\] toward her calf when born.

## Notes
Ppp. has *sāmnasyam* in **a**, and in **c** *anyo ‘nyam*, as demanded by  
the meter. The comm. also reads the latter, and for the former  
*sāmmanuṣyam;* and he ends the verse with *aghnyās*.
