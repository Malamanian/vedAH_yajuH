title = "०४ येन देवा"

## Translation
4. That incantation in virtue of which the gods do not go apart, nor  
hate one another mutually, we perform in your house, concord for  
\[your\] men (*púruṣa*).

## Notes
Weber suggests that "gods" here perhaps means "Brāhmans," but there is  
no authority nor occasion for such an understanding; the comm. also says  
"Indra etc."
