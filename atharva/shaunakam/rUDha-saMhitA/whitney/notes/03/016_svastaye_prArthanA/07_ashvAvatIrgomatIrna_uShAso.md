## Translation
7. Let excellent dawns, rich in horses, rich in kine, rich in heroes,  
always shine for us, yielding (*duh*) ghee, on all sides drunk of: do ye  
protect us ever with well-beings.

## Notes
TB. read *prápīnās* at end of **c**; Ppp. has instead *pravīṇās;* the  
comm. explains by *āpyāyitās* 'filled up, made teeming,' which is very  
possibly to be preferred. ⌊Delete the accent-mark under *gómatīr.*⌋
