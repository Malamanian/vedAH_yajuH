title = "०५ भग एव"

## Translation
5. Let the god Bhaga himself be fortunate; through him may we be  
fortunate; on thee here, Bhaga, do I call entire; do thou, O Bhaga, be  
our forerunner here.

## Notes
RV. (with VS. and TB.) leaves the final of *téna* unlengthened at  
beginning of **b**; and RV. and VS. make the sense of **c** better by  
reading *johavīti;* all the three have at the end of **a** the voc.  
*devās.* ⌊Comm. to TB. makes *johavīmi = āhvayati!*⌋
