## Translation
4. When these formerly went further forth, approaching each unfading  
seat—the poet of the dry (? *śuṣá*), the two licking mothers—do ye (two)  
send for the sister (*jāmí*) a capable (*dhúrya*) spouse.

## Notes
The translation is, of course, simple nonsense. None of ⌊our⌋ mss.  
accent *gus* in **a**; P.M. accent *pūrvyàm* before it; one (T.)  
combines *-nto ‘juryám* in **b**.
