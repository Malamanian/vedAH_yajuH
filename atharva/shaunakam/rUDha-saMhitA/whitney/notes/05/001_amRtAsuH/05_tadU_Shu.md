## Translation
5. This great homage, verily, to thee, O broad-going one, do I a poet  
make with poesy (*kā́vya*); when the two (m.), going united (*samyáñc*)  
against the earth (*kṣā́*), \[then\] increase here the (two) great  
bank-wheeled (? *ródhacakra*) ones (f.).

## Notes
"Bank-wheeled," i.e. rolling on between their banks. *Tát* in our text  
(beginning of **c**) is a misprint for *yát*. Prāt. iii. 4 determines  
*ū*; ii. 97 determines *ṣú;* *vāvṛdhéte* (p. *vav-*) is by iii. 13. The  
Kāuś. use of the verse seems suggested simply by *samyáñcāu*. The  
irregular verse (9 + 11: 11 + 12 = 43) is very imperfectly defined by  
the Anukr. ⌊The London ms. of the Anukr. is here in disorder: and  
perhaps we ought to read *puro-bṛhatī* for *parā-*.⌋
