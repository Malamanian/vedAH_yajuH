## Translation
1. He who came to (*ā-bhū*) the womb (*yóni*) with a special sacred  
text (? *ṛ́dhan̄mantra*), of immortal spirit (*-ásu*), increasing, of good  
birth, of unharmed spirit, shining like the days—Trita the maintainer  
maintained three (*trí*, neuter).

## Notes
The Pet. Lexx. render *ṛ́dhan̄mantra* by "lacking speech"; Ludwig, by "of  
distinguished meditation." *Ahe ’va* (p. *áhā॰iva*) is perhaps rather to  
be understood as *áhaḥ॰iva*. Ppp. puts *sujanmā* in **b** before  
*vardhamānas*. As elsewhere, part of our mss. (Bp.p.m.P.M.W.) read  
*tṛtás* in **d**. The last pāda is two syllables short, the Anukr.  
taking no notice of the deficiency.
