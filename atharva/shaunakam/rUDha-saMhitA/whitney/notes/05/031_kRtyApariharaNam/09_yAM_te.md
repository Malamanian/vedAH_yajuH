## Translation
9. What \[witchcraft\] they have made for thee in the human-bone, and  
what in the destroying (? *sáṁkasuka*) fire, \[what\] dimming,  
out-burning, flesh-eating one—I take that back again.

## Notes
'Human-bone' (if not a corrupt reading) is perhaps an epithet of the  
funeral fire = 'the fire which leaves of the human body nothing but  
fragments of bone.'
