title = "११ यश्चकार न"

## Translation
11. He who hath made hath not been able to make; he hath crushed a foot,  
a finger; he, fortuneless, hath made what is excellent for us \[who  
are\] fortunate ones.

## Notes
The first three pādas are identical with iv. 18. 6 **a-c**, and our  
**d** here is read by Ppp. in that hymn ⌊but with *abhagā* for *-gó*⌋.  
The Anukr. gives the same false definition of meter in both places. ⌊See  
notes to iv. 18. 6.⌋
