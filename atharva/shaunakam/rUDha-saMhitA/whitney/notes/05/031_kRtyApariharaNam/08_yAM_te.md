## Translation
8. What witchcraft they have put down for thee in the well, or have dug  
in at the cemetery; in the seat (*sádman*) what witchcraft they have  
made—I take that back again.

## Notes
The indefinite 'seat' may be used for 'dwelling,' or for 'place of  
sacrifice.' The Anukr. takes no notice of the metrical irregularities in  
**a, b**.
