## Translation
1. What \[witchcraft\] they have made for thee in a raw vessel, what  
they have made in one of mixed grains; in raw flesh what witchcraft they  
have made—I take that back again.

## Notes
That is, doubtless, 'back to its maker': cf. iv. 18. 4; and, for the  
whole verse, iv. 17. 4. The Anukr. makes no account of the redundant  
syllable in **c**.
