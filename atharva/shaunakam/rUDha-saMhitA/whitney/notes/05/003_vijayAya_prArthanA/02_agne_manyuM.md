## Translation
2. O Agni, pushing back the fury of our adversaries, do thou, our keeper  
(*gopā́*), protect us about on all sides; let our abusers (*durasyú*) go  
away downwards; among themselves (*amā́*) let the intent of them awaking  
be lost.

## Notes
RV's version of **b, c** reads thus: *ádabdho gopā́ḥ pári pāhi nas tvám:  
pratyáñco yantu nigútaḥ púnas té;* and TS. has the same. But TS. also  
reads *agnís* at the beginning, *purástāt* for *páreṣām* in **a**, and  
*prabúdhā* in **d**. Ppp. has *prabudhā* for *nivátā* in **c**, and, for  
**d**, *mamīṣāṁ cittaṁ bahudhā vi naśyatu*. The verse is properly  
*svarāj*, **b** as well as **c** being *jagatī*. ⌊Correct *gāpā́ḥ* to  
*gopā́ḥ*.⌋
