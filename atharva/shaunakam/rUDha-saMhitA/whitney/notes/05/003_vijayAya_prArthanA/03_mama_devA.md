title = "०३ मम देवा"

## Translation
3. Let all the gods be at my separate call—the Maruts with Indra,  
Vishṇu, Agni; let the broad-spaced atmosphere be mine; let the wind blow  
(*pū*) for me unto this desire.

## Notes
RV. reads at the end *kā́me asmín*, and Ppp. agrees with it, also TS. TS.  
has further *índrāvantas* in **b**, and in **c**, strangely enough, *urú  
gopám*, as two separate words.
