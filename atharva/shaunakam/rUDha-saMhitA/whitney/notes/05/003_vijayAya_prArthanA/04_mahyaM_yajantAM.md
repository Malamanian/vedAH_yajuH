title = "०४ मह्यं यजन्तां"

## Translation
4. Let what sacrifices I make make sacrifice for me; let my mind's  
design be realized (*satyā́*); let me not fall into (*ni-gā*) any sin  
soever; let all the gods defend me here.

## Notes
RV. and TS. read *yajantu* and *havyā́* (for *iṣṭā́*) in **a**, and, for  
**d**, *víśve devāso ádhi vocatā naḥ* (but TS. *me*). Ppp. agrees with  
our text except for ending with *mām iha*.
