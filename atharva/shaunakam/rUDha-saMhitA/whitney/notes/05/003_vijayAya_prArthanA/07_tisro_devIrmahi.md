## Translation
7. Ye three goddesses, grant (*yam*) us great protection, what is  
prosperous (*puṣṭá*) for our progeny and for ourselves (*tanū́*); let us  
not be deserted (*hā*) by progeny nor selves; let us not be made subject  
to the hater, O king Soma.

## Notes
All the mss. accent at the beginning *tisrás;* our text emends to  
*tísras*. The second half-verse, as above noted, goes with our 6 **a,  
b** to make one verse in RV. and TS.; and also in Ppp., which has the  
variant *dhanena* for *tanūbhis* in **c**. For the present verse, Ppp.  
agrees in the first half with our text, only reading *me* for *nas;* for  
second half it has: *māṁ viṣas saṁmanaso juṣantāṁ pitryaṁ kṣatraṁ pṛta  
jānātv asmāt*. The Anukr. ignores the extra syllable in **a**.
