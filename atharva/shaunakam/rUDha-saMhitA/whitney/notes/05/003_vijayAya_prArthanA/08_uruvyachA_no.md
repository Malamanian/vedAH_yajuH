## Translation
8. Let the bull (*mahiṣá*) of wide expanse grant us protection, having  
much food (*-kṣú*), \[he\] the much-invoked in this invocation; do thou  
be gracious unto our progeny, O thou of the bay horses; O Indra, harm us  
not, do not abandon us.

## Notes
RV. and TS. read *yaṁsad* at end of **a**, and *mṛḍaya* at end of **c**  
(also our O.); at end of **b**, RV. and Ppp. have *-kṣúḥ*, while TS.  
agrees with our text. In **d** the *pada*-text has *ririṣaḥ*, by Prāt.  
iv. 86. The Anukr. takes no notice of the two redundant syllables in  
**a**.
