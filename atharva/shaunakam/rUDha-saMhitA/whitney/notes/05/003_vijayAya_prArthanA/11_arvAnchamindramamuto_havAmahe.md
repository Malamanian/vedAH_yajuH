## Translation
11. Hitherward do we call Indra from yonder, who is kine-conquering,  
riches-conquering, who is horse-conquering; let him hear this sacrifice  
of ours at our separate call; of us, O thou of the bay horses, hast thou  
been the ally (*medín*).

## Notes
The verse is found in TS., and in TB. (as above), and is the first of a  
long addition to RV. x. 128. All these read alike in **c, d**: *vihavé  
juṣasvā ’syá kurmo* (RV. *kulmo*) *harivo medínaṁ tvā;* Ppp. nearly  
agrees, reading instead *v. j. ’smākaṁ kṛṇvo h. m. tva*. The Anukr.  
apparently balances the redundancy of **a** against the deficiency of  
**b**.
