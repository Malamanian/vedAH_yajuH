## Translation
1. Be splendor mine, O Agni, in rival invocations (*vihavá*); may we,  
kindling thee, adorn ourselves; let the four directions bow to me; with  
thee as overseer may we conquer the fighters.

## Notes
The other texts (with MS. i. 4. 1) have no variants in this verse. Ppp.  
appears to read *prathema* for *puṣema* in **b**.
