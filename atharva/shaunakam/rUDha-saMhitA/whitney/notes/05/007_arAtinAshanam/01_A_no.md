## Translation
1. Bring to us, stand not about, O niggard; do not prevent (? *rakṣ*)  
our sacrificial gift as led \[away\]; homage be to baffling (*vīrtsā́*),  
to ill-success; homage be to the niggard.

## Notes
P.M.W. omit *mā́* in **a**. One sees, without approving, the ground of  
the metrical definition of the Anukr.
