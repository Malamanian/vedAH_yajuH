## Translation
6. Do not thou baffle our winning nor speech. Let Indra and Agni both  
bring good things to us. De ye all, willing today to give to us, welcome  
the niggard.

## Notes
That is, probably (if the reading is correct), give a pleasant reception  
that may win favor. The mss. vary between *vī̀rtsīs* and *vī́r-*;  
theoretically, the former is decidedly to be preferred, for, if *í* +  
*i* make *ī̀*, then *a fortiori* *i* + *í*: see note to Prāt. iii. 56. In  
**c**, H.E.O.K. read *ṇo* after *sárve*. The first half-verse is very  
irregular.
