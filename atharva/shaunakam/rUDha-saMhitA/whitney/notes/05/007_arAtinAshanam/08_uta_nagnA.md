title = "०८ उत नग्ना"

## Translation
8. Likewise, greatly making thyself naked, thou fastenest on (*sac*) a  
person in dreams, O niggard, baffling the plan and design of a man  
(*púruṣa*).

## Notes
It seems as if *nagnā bobhuvatī* were the equivalent of *mahānagnī  
bhavantī* 'becoming a wanton,' the intensive element being shifted from  
the adjective to the verb. The *pada*-text reads *svapna-yā́*, by Prāt.  
iv. 30.
