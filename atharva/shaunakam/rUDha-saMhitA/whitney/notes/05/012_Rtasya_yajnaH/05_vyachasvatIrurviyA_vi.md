## Translation
5. Expansive let them open (*vi-śri*) widely, like wives adorned for  
their husbands; ye great, divine, all-furthering doors, be ye favorable  
to the advance of the gods.

## Notes
Our *pada*-text divides the last word as *su-prāyanā́ḥ,* while the RV.  
*pada* has *supra-ayanā́ḥ;* the meter appears to indicate that  
*suprayāṇā́ḥ* is the true original reading.
