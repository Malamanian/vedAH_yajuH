## Translation
7. The (two) invokers of the gods, first, well-voiced, shaping (*mā*)  
the sacrifice for man (*mánus*) to sacrifice, urging forward at the  
councils (*vidátha*) the (two) singers (*kārú*), pointing out forward  
light through the fore-region.

## Notes
There are no variants. ⌊Griffith, after Mahīdhara, takes the "light" as  
the *āhavanīya* fire.⌋
