## Translation
6. Let Dawn and Night, dripping (? *suṣvay-*), worshipful, close, sit  
down here in the lair (*yóni*)—the two heavenly, great, well-shining  
women, putting on beauty (*śrī́*) with bright adornment.

## Notes
The other texts differ from ours only by accenting *úpāke*. ⌊The comment  
to Prāt, ii. 91 cites *suṣvay* as a case of reduplication; and BR. vii.  
1142 connect it with *su* 'impel.' But see Weber.—He renders *ā́* by  
'Heran.'⌋
