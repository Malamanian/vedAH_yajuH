## Translation
1. Kindled this day in the home of man (*mánus*), thou, a god, O  
Jātavedas, dost sacrifice to the gods; and do thou bring \[them\],  
understanding it, O thou of friendly might; thou art a forethoughtful  
messenger, poet.

## Notes
The only variant in this verse is that MS. omits the peculiar and  
problematic accent of *váha* in **c**.
