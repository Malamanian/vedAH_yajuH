## Translation
2. O Tanūnapāt (son of thyself?), do thou, anointing with honey  
(*mádhu*) the roads that go to righteousness (*ṛtá*), sweeten them, O  
well-tongued one; prospering (*ṛdh*) with prayers (did) the devotions  
(*mánman*) and the sacrifice, put (*kṛ*) thou also among the gods our  
service (*adhvará*).

## Notes
The mss. accent, without assignable reason, *svadáyā* in **b**, but the  
edition emends to *svadayā*, in agreement with the other texts.  
  
The three Yajus-texts insert between this verse and the next an  
alternative invocation to Narāśaṅsa (RV. vii. 2. 2).
