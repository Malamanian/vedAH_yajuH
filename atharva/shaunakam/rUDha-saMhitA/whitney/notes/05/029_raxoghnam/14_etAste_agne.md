title = "१४ एतास्ते अग्ने"

## Translation
14. These, O Agni, are thy *piśācá*-grinding pieces of fuel; them do  
thou enjoy, and accept them, O Jātavedas.

## Notes
The irregular and defective meter of this verse is very inaccurately  
described by the Anukr.; it counts as 8 + 6: 5 + 11 syllables, having  
thus a *kakubh*-element (**b**), but no *bṛhatī*.
