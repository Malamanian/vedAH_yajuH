## Translation
4. Pierce thou into his eyes, pierce into his heart, bore into his  
tongue, destroy (*pra-mṛ*) his teeth; whatsoever *piśācá* hath devoured  
of him, that one, O Agni, youngest \[god\], do thou crush back.

## Notes
Ppp. reads for **a** *mokṣāu na viddhi hṛdayaṁ na viddhi* and *piśāco  
syatamo* in **c**, and *yaviṣṭhaṣ* in **d**. Kāuś. (25. 24) quotes the  
verse in a remedial ceremony.
