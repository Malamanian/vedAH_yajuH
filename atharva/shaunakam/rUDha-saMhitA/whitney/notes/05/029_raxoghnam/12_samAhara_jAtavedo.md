## Translation
 12. Bring together, O Jātavedas, what is taken, what borne away; let  
his members (*gā́tra*) increase; let this man fill up like a soma-stalk.

## Notes
Ppp. begins with *samābhara*, and has *jagdham* for *hṛtam* in **b**.  
The Anukr. refuses to sanction the abbreviation *’va* in **d**.
