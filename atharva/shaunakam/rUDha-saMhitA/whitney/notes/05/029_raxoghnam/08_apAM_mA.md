## Translation
8. In the drinking of waters whatever flesh-eater hath injured me lying  
(*śī*) in the lair (*śáyana*) of the familiar demons (*yātú*)—that let  
the *piśācás* etc. etc.

## Notes
We are tempted to emend (with Ludwig) *śáyānam* to *śáyānas* at end of  
**b**. Ppp. reads here, in **a, b**, nearly our 6 **a, b, a** with the  
three variants given above, and **b** with *imam* for *yo mā*, and with  
*‘śane;* and it adds our 10 **c, d** instead of the refrain.
