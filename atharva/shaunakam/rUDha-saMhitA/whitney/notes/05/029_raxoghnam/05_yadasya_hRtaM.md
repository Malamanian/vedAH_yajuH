## Translation
5. What of him is taken \[or\] taken apart, what is borne away,  
whatsoever of himself is devoured by the *piśācás*, that, O Agni, do  
thou, knowing, bring again; into his body we send flesh \[and\] spirit  
(*ásu*).

## Notes
Ppp. reads for **d** *śarīre prāṇam asum erayā saṁ sṛjema*. The Anukr.  
defines the meter correctly, according to its methods.
