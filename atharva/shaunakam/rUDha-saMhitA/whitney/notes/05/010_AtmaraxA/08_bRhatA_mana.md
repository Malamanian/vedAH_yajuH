title = "०८ बृहता मन"

## Translation
8. By the great one (*bṛhát*) I call unto mind; by Mātariśvan, unto  
breath and expiration; from the sun \[I call\] sight, from the  
atmosphere hearing, from the earth body; by Sarasvatī, mind-yoked, we  
call unto speech.

## Notes
The verse divides most naturally as 9 + 9: 16: 16 = 50; the metrical  
definition of the Anukr. fits it very ill. ⌊For **c**, cf. v. 7. 5.⌋  
  
The second *anuvāka* ends here, and contains 5 hymns and 49 verses; the  
old Anukr. says *ādyāt para ekādaśahīnaṣaṣṭiḥ*.
