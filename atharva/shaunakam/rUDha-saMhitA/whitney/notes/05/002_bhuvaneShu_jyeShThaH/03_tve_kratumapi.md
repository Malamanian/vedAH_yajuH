## Translation
3. In thee they mingle skill abundantly, when they twice, thrice become  
\[thine\] aids; unite thou with sweet (*svādú*) what is sweeter than  
sweet; mayest thou fight against yonder honey with honey (*mádhu*).

## Notes
RV. differs only by reading *vṛñjanti víśve* at end of **a**; and SV.  
(ii. 835) and AA. (as above) agree with it throughout; as does also  
Ppp.; TS. (iii. 5. 10¹) begins **d** with *áta ū ṣú*, and ends it with  
*yodhi*, which looks like a more original reading. ⌊Cf. Geldner, *Ved.  
Stud*. ii. 10.⌋
