## Translation
4. If now after thee that conquerest riches in contest after contest  
(*ráṇa*) the devout ones (*vípra*) revel, more forcible, O vehement one,  
extend thou what is stanch; let not the ill-conditioned Kaśokas damage  
thee.

## Notes
RV. begins **a** with *íti cid dhí tvā*, and **b** with *máde-made;* in  
**c** it reads (with Ppp.) *dhṛṣṇo* for *śuṣmin*, and at the end of the  
verse *yātudhā́nā durévāḥ;* Ppp. has instead *durevā yātudhānāḥ*.
