## Translation
1. That verily was the chief among beings whence was born the formidable  
one, of bright manliness; as soon as born, he dissolves \[his\] foes,  
when all \[his\] aids (*ū́ma*) revel after him.

## Notes
RV. reads in **d** *ánu yáṁ víśve mádanty ū́māḥ*, and all the other texts  
(SV. ii. 833; VS. xxxiii. 80; AA. i. 3. 4) agree with it. The Anukr.  
ignores the considerable metrical irregularities.
