## Translation
9. The eared hedgehog said this, coming down from the mountain:  
whichsoever of these (f.) are produced by digging, of them the poison is  
most sapless.

## Notes
This verse, which is rather out of place here, seems like a variation of  
RV. i. 191. 16: *kuṣumbhakás tád abravīd giréḥ pravartamānakáḥ:  
vṛ́ścikasyā ’rasáṁ viṣám*. Ppp. begins with *kaṇvā*. ⌊For the diminutive,  
cf. iv. 37. 10 and xiv. 2. 63.⌋
