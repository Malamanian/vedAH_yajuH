## Translation
1. Since Varuṇa, poet of heaven, hath given \[them\] to me, with  
formidable spells (*vácas*) do I dissolve thy poison; what is dug,  
undug, and attached (*saktá*) have I seized; like drink (*írā*) on a  
waste hath thy poison been wasted (*ni-jas*).

## Notes
The epithets in **c** are of obscure application: probably buried in the  
flesh by the bite, or unburied but clinging.
