## Translation
2. What waterless poison is thine, that of thine have I seized in these;  
I seize thy midmost, thine upmost juice (*rása*); also may thy lowest  
then disappear for fright.

## Notes
'These' in **b** is fem. (*etā́su*); doubtless 'waters' is to be  
supplied. Ppp. reads in **a** *padakam* (for *apod-*), and in **b** *tat  
tābhir*. *Yát ta* in **a** in our edition is a misprint for *yát te*.  
Kāuś. (29. 2) calls the verse *grahaṇī*. ⌊For *neśat*, see *Skt. Gram.*  
§847 end, and §854 b.⌋
