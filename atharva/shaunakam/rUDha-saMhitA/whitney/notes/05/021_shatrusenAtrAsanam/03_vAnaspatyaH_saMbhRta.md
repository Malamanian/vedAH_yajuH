## Translation
3. Made of forest-tree, brought together with the ruddy \[kine\],  
belonging to all the families (*-gotrá-*), speak thou alarm for our  
enemies, being smeared with sacrificial butter.

## Notes
The metrical structure is very irregular, though the right number of  
syllables can be forced out, if the divisions of pādas be overridden;  
the Anukr. takes no heed. The first three words constituted 20. 1 **b**.  
⌊The usual sign of pāda-division to be expected after *sáṁbhṛta* is  
lacking in Bp. In **c**, we may pronounce *pratrāsā́mít-*.⌋
