## Translation
11. Do ye \[who are\] formidable, O Maruts, sons of the spotted mother,  
with Indra as ally, slaughter our foes.

## Notes
King Soma, king Varuṇa, the great god, also Death, Indra—  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
The first half-verse is repeated below as xiii. 1. 3 **a, b**. The verse  
is translated by Muir (iv². 333). The Anukr. correctly reckons **c** as  
a *bṛhatī*-pāda, but takes no notice of the redundant syllable in **a**,  
or of the deficient one in **d**, perhaps reckoning them as balancing  
one another. The second half-verse would be better treated as  
constituting one paragraph (unmetrical) with our vs. 12.
