## Translation
1. Division of hearts, division of minds speak thou among our enemies, O  
drum; mutual hate, confusion, fear, we put into our enemies: smite them  
down, O drum.

## Notes
Pāda **a** might also be understood as 'heartlessness, mindlessness.'  
*Káśmaśa* (in **c**) occurs here only, and is very possibly only a  
misreading for *kaśmala*, as equivalent to which it is here translated.
