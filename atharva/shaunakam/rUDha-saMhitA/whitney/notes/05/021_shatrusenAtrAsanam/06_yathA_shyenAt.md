## Translation
6. As the birds (*patatrín*) are all in a tremble at the falcon, day by  
day; as at the thundering of the lion, so do thou, O drum etc. etc.

## Notes
Pāda **c** ⌊as the sense shows⌋ seems to have dropped in here by  
accident out of vs. 5 (or possibly 4), where alone it fits the  
connection. *Ahardivi* occurs again in Pāipp. v. 3. 1, 3: *indrāgnī  
tasmāt tvāi ’nasaḥ pari pātām ahardivi*. The Anukr. calls the verse  
simply *jagatī* (on account of its 48 syllables), but probably by an  
accidental omission of the epithet *ṣaṭpadī*, 'of six pādas,' which it  
usually adds in such a case.
