## Translation
7. What embryos are aborted (*ava-pad*), what living creatures (*jágat*)  
are torn away (*apa-lup*), what heroes are mutually shattered—them the  
Brahman's wife injures.

## Notes
B. reads *nṛtyánte* in **c**, P.M. *tṛhyáte*, D. *nūhyante*. That is,  
all this mischief is the consequence of her ill-treatment. Ppp. combines  
*garbhā ’vap-* in **a**, and reads *abhilupyate* in **b**, and  
*hanyante* in **c**.
