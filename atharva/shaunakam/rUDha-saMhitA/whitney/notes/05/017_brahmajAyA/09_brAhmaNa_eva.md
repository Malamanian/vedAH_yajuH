title = "०९ ब्राह्मण एव"

## Translation
9. A Brahman \[is\] indeed her husband, not a noble (*rājanyà*), not a  
Vāiśya: this the sun goes proclaiming to the five races of men  
(*mānavá*).

## Notes
The Anukr. does not notice the deficient syllable in **a** (unless we  
are to syllabize *bṛ-āh-*, which is very harsh). Ppp. combines *brāhmaṇe  
’va* in **a**, and puts the verse at the end of the hymn.
