title = "१० पुनर्वै देवा"

## Translation
10. The gods verily gave back; men (*manuṣyà*) gave back; kings,  
apprehending (*grah*) truth, gave back the Brahman's wife.

## Notes
RV. has *utá* instead of the repeated *adadus* in **b**; and it gives  
the better reading *kṛṇvānā́s* in **c**. And in both points Ppp. agrees  
with it ⌊but with *-no* for *-nās*⌋.
