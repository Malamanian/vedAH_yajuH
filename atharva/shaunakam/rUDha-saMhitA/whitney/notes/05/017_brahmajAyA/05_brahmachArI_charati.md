## Translation
5. The Vedic student (*brahmacārin*) goes about serving (*viṣ*) much  
service; he becomes one limb of the gods; by him Brihaspati discovered  
the wife, conducted by Soma, like the sacrificial spoon, O gods.

## Notes
In **d** RV. has the doubtless better reading *devā́s*, 'as the gods  
\[discovered\] the sacrificial spoon.' For *nītā́m* Ppp. reads *nihatām*.  
Though called a *triṣṭubh*, the verse has two *jagatī* pādas.
