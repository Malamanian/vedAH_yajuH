title = "१२ नास्य जाया"

## Translation
12. Not on his couch lies a beautiful hundred-bringing (*-vāhī́*) wife,  
in whose kingdom the Brahman's wife is obstructed through ignorance.

## Notes
Literally, 'in what kingdom'; 'obstructed,' i.e. 'kept from him.'  
'Hundred,' i.e., probably, 'a rich dowry' (so the Pet. Lex.). The mss.  
have, as is usual in such cases, *ácityā*.
