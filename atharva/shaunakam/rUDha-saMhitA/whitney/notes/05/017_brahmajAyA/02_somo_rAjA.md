## Translation
2. King Soma first gave (*pra-yam*) back the Brahman's wife, not bearing  
enmity; he who went after \[her\] was Varuṇa, Mitra; Agni, invoker,  
conducted \[her\] hither, seizing her hand.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *mitro ā-* in **c**. *Anvartitár* ⌊*Gram.* §233 a⌋ is  
doubtful; perhaps 'one who disputes possession': cf. MS. iii. 7. 3 (p.  
78. 1).
