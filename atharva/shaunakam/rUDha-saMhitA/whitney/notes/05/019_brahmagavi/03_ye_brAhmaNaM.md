title = "०३ ये ब्राह्मणं"

## Translation
3. They who spat upon a Brahman, or who sent \[their\] mucus at him—they  
sit in the midst of a stream of blood, devouring hair.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *asmāi* in **b**, and combines *-ntā ”sate* in **d**. Read in  
our text *īṣiré* at the end (an accent-sign, lost under *ṣi*).
