## Translation
 10. King Varuṇa called that a god-made poison; no one soever, having  
devoured the cow of the Brahman, keeps watch in the kingdom.

## Notes
That is, guards successfully his realm: *jāgāra*, as such passages as  
xiii. i. 9, xix. 24. 2; 48. 5 plainly show, belongs to *gṛ* (*jāgṛ*)  
'wake,' and not to *jṛ* 'waste away, grow old,' as claimed in the minor  
Pet. Lex. Ppp. has *jāgara*, and *dugdhvā* in **c**.
