title = "०५ क्रूरमस्या आशसनं"

## Translation
5. Cruel is the cutting up of her; harsh to eat (?) is her prepared  
flesh (*piśitám*); in that the milk (*kṣīrá*) of her is drunk, that  
verily is an offense against the Fathers.

## Notes
The translation implies emendation of *asyate* in **b** to *asyate*, as  
suggested by Zimmer; Ppp. unfortunately lacks the verse.
