title = "११ नवैव ता"

## Translation
11. Those same nine nineties whom the earth shook off, having injured  
the progeny of the Brahman, perished irretrievably.

## Notes
This verse is nearly the same with 18. 12 above; and the various  
accentuations of *vyádhūnuta* are precisely the same here as there.
