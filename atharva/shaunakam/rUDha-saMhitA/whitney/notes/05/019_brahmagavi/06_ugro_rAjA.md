## Translation
6. A king who thinks himself formidable, \[and\] who desires to devour a  
Brahman—that kingdom is poured away, where a Brahman is scathed (*jyā*).

## Notes
*Yáj jíghatsati* in **b** is an error for *yó j-*. 'Pour away,'  
doubtless a figure from the pouring off onto the ground of worthless  
liquid. With **a, b** compare RV. ii. 23. 12.
