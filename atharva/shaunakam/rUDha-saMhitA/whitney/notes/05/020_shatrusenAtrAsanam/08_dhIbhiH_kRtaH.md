## Translation
8. Made by devices (*dhī́*), may it speak forth its voice; excite thou  
the weapons of the warriors; allied with Indra, call in the warriors; by  
friends smite mightily down the enemies.

## Notes
'By devices': i.e., apparently, with art. Emendation of *vadāti* to  
*vadāsi* in **a** is very desirable; Ppp. has the 2d pers. *bharasva*  
instead; and, as noted above, it substitutes our 6 **c, d** for the  
second half-verse. There is a syllable lacking in **a**.
