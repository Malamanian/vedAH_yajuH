## Translation
5. Hearing the uttered (*pra-yam*) voice of the drum speaking, let the  
woman, suppliant, noise-wakened, run to her son, seizing his hand—our  
enemy, frightened in the conflict of deadly weapons.

## Notes
One might conjecture in **a** *prayatā́m* 'of \[us\] advancing.' This  
verse and 6 and 9 are really the only regular *triṣṭubhs* of the hymn.
