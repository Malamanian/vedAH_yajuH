## Translation
7. Since thou verily, O Varuṇa, speakest many reproachful things among  
(as to?) re-bestowers, do not thou, I pray, belong to (*abhi-bhū*) such  
*paṇís;* let not people call thee ungenerous (*arādhás*).

## Notes
The rendering implies emendation of *bhūt* to *bhūs* at end of **c**,  
which is made also by Roth and Muir. The pāda is corrupt in Pāipp.
