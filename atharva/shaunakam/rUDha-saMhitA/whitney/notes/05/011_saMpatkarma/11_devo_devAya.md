## Translation
11. A god, bestower of vigor on a singing god; a sage (*vípra*), of good  
wisdom for a praising sage.

## Notes
Since thou, O self-ruling Varuṇa, hast generated father Atharvan,  
connection of the gods, for him do thou make well-extolled generosity;  
our comrade art thou, and highest connection.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
The first line is here (with Muir, and Zimmer, p. 205) taken as  
belonging to Varuṇa's reply given in the preceding verse. We must emend  
at the end either to *paramáś ca* or to *bándhu*. All the mss. leave  
*stuvate* in **b** unaccented, as if it were a verb-form. Ppp. reads  
*svadhāvaṁ* in **c**, *viśvadevam* at end of **d**, *urvāyuṣ kṛṇuhi  
praś-* in **e**, and, for **f**, *sakhā no ‘sti varuṇaś ca bandhuḥ*. The  
Anukr. makes no account of the extra syllable in **e**. In **b**, the  
vertical over *su-* is gone. ⌊Pādas **c-f** are not part of the  
dialogue.⌋
