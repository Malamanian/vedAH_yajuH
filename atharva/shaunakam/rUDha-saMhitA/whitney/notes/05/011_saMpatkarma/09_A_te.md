## Translation
9. Let uplifted (*ud-yam*) songs of praise of thee come, among all human  
regions. Give now to me what thou hast not given me; thou art my  
suitable comrade of seven steps;—

## Notes
That is, apparently, ready to go seven steps (or any indefinite  
distance) with me. Roth suggests as an improved reading *ā́dattas* 'hast  
taken from me' in **c**, and Muir so renders. Both words are alike, and  
equally, wrong grammatically, using the passive pple in the sense of an  
active; *ádattam ásti* would be correct, and at this Ppp. perhaps  
points: *dehi taṁ mahyaṁ yadi tatvam asti yadyo nas saptapadaḥ sakhā  
’saḥ*. Ppp. also begins with *yā te stotrāṇi bandhanāni yāni*, and  
apparently has *dikṣu* in **b**.
