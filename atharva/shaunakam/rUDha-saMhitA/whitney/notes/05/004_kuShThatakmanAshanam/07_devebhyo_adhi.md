## Translation
7. From the gods art thou born; of Soma art thou set as companion; do  
thou be gracious to my breath, out-breathing, sight here.

## Notes
E.H. accent *jātó ‘si* in **a** (p. *jātáḥ: asi*). Ppp. reads *apānāya*  
for *vyān-* in **c**, and at the end *‘sya mṛḍa*, which is easier. ⌊Cf.  
Hillebrandt, *Mythologie*, i. 65.⌋
