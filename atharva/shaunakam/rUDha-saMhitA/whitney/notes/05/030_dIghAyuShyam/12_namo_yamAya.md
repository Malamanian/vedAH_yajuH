title = "१२ नमो यमाय"

## Translation
12. Homage to Yama, homage be to Death; homage to the Fathers, and \[to  
them\] who conduct \[away\]; that Agni who understands (*vid*)   
deliverance (*utpáraṇa*) do I put forward (*puro-dhā*), in order to this  
man's being unharmed.

## Notes
With **b** compare viii. i. 8 **b**, which appears to give the clew to  
the meaning; *utpāraṇa* is the action-noun to *ut-pāray* (viii. 1.  
17-19; 2. 9). The verse, though by number of syllables a *virāḍ jagatī*  
(46 syll.), has plainly five pādas ⌊12 + 11: 8 + 7 + 8; in **d**, read  
*táṁ-tam* for *tám* as at iv. 30. 3?⌋. Ppp. omits the last pāda.
