title = "१७ अयं लोकः"

## Translation
17. This \[is\] the dearest world of the gods, unconquered. Unto what  
death appointed, O man, thou wast born here, we and it call after thee:  
do not die before old age.

## Notes
By one of the most absurd of the many blunders of the *pada*-text, we  
find *puruṣa॰jajñiṣé* in **d** treated by it as a compound. Ppp. reads,  
for **c-e**, *tasmāi tvam iha jajñiṣé adṛṣṭaṣ puruṣa mṛtyave: tasmāi tvā  
ni hvayāmasi*.
