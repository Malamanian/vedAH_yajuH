## Translation
5. What thy mother, what thy father, sister (*jāmí*), and brother shall  
infuse (? *sárjatas*)—heed (*sev*) thou the opposing remedy; I make thee  
one who reaches old age.

## Notes
*Sárjatas* is a puzzle, as regards both form and sense; 'give ' (Ludwig)  
and 'offer' (Muir) are wholly unsatisfactory; 'weave witchcraft' (Pet.  
Lex.) is quite too pregnant. Ppp. gives no help; it reads in **c**  
*chevasya* after *pratyak*. The translation takes the word as a  
root-aorist subj. from *sṛj*.
