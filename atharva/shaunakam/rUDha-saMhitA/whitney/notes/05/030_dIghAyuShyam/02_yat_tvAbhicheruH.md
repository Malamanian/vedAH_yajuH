## Translation
2. In that men have bewitched thee, one of thine own people \[or\] a  
strange person—deliverance and release, both I speak for thee with my  
voice.

## Notes
The translation implies emendation to *púruṣās* in **a**; all the mss.  
have *-ṣas*. ⌊SPP's texts have *-ṣas* without note of variant. We may  
construe it with the second *yát:* 'If they (subject indef.) have  
bewitched thee, if a man of thine own' etc.—supply *abhicacā́ra*⌋.
