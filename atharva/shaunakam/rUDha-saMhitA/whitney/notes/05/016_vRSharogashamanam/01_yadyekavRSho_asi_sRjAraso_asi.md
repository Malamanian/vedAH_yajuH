## Translation
1. If thou art sole chief, let go; sapless art thou.

## Notes
We have *ekavṛṣá*, lit. 'one bull,' in other passages (iv. 22; vi. 86),  
but *dvivṛṣá* etc. only here, and they are plainly nothing but schematic  
variations of it, not admitting of real translation. Perhaps the hymn is  
directed against insect pests, through their leaders, whether few or  
many. The definition of the Anukr. implies fourteen syllables: perhaps  
as *yádi ekavṛṣó ási sṛjá arasò ‘si* (or *sṛjā́ ’rasó asi*). Ppp. has  
*yas* for *yadi* in all the verses. ⌊See Weber's note.⌋
