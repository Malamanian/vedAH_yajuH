title = "०५ मित्रावरुणौ वृष्ट्याधिपती"

## Translation
5. Mitra-and-Varuṇa are overlords of rain; let them favor etc. etc.

## Notes
This item is wanting in all the other texts. The mss. all read *vṛṣṭyā́  
’dhip-* (p. *vṛṣṭyā́: ádhip-*), the error doubtless originating in a  
double *saṁdhi*, such as is extremely frequent in Ppp.
