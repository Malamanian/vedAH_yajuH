## Translation
17. The Fathers (*tatá*), the grandfathers (*tatāmahá*)—let them favor  
etc. etc.

## Notes
The translation implies emendation to *tatā́s* at the beginning of vs.  
17, as the sense seems to require, and as the other texts suggest. Ppp.  
combines vss. 15-17, reading *pitaras pare ‘varas tatas tadāmahas te mā*  
etc.; TS. (iii. 4. 5: and PGS.), *pítaraḥ pitāmahāḥ pare ‘vare tátās  
tatāmahā ihá mā* etc.; TS. iv. 3. 3², *pitáraḥ pitāmahā́ḥ páré ‘vare té  
naḥ* etc., with which MS. agrees. Two of our mss. (O.D.) begin vs. 17  
with *tatás tat-*; the rest have *tátas*, and our printed text follows  
them.
