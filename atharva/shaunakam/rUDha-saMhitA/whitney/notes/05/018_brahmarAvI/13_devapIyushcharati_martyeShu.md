## Translation
13. The insulter of the gods goes about among mortals; he becomes one  
who has swallowed poison, \[becomes\] mainly composed of bones; he who  
injures the Brahman, the connection of the gods, he goes not to the  
world to which the Fathers go.

## Notes
*Garagīrṇá* is an anomalous compound, but its meaning is hardly  
doubtful; it is so interpreted by the comm. to AśS. ix. 5. 1;  
*ásthibhūyān*, virtually 'reduced to a skeleton.' Ppp. exchanges our 4  
**c, d** and 13 **c, d**, givinig the former here without a variant.
