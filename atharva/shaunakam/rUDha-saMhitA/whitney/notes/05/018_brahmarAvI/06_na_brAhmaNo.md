## Translation
6. The Brahman is not to be injured, like fire, by one who holds himself  
dear; for Soma is his heir, Indra his protector against imprecation.

## Notes
The Pet. Lex. suggests the (acceptable, but unnecessary) emendation of  
**b** to *agnéḥ priyā́ tanū́r iva;* this, however, is favored by the  
reading of Ppp., *agneṣ priyatamā tanūḥ*. The expression seems to be  
incomplete: "as fire \[is not to be touched\] by one" etc. Ppp. also  
combines *indro ‘sya* in **d**. It is strange that the *pada*-text does  
not divide *dāyādáḥ* ⌊BR. *dāyá* + *āda*⌋ as a compound word.
