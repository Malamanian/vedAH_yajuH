title = "१० ये सहस्रमराजन्नासन्"

## Translation
10. They that ruled, a thousand, and were ten hundreds, those  
Vāitahavyas, having devoured the cow of the Brahman, perished  
(*parā-bhū*).

## Notes
*Sahásram* is taken as in apposition with *yé*, since *rāj* properly  
governs a genitive. Ppp. has a different **c**, *tebhyaḥ prabravīmi  
tvā*. A syllable is lacking in **a**, unnoted by the Anukr.
