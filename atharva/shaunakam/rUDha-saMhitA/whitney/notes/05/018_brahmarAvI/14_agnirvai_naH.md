## Translation
14. Agni verily our guide. Soma is called \[our\] heir, Indra slayer of  
imprecation (?): so know the devout that.

## Notes
Ppp. reads, for second half-verse, *jayatā ’bhiśasta indras tat satyaṁ  
devasaṁhitam*. Pāda **c** plainly calls for correction (*pada* has  
*abhí॰śastā*); Zimmer proposes *abhíśastam*, the Pet. Lex. ⌊vii. 1515⌋  
*abhíśastim;* *abhíśatyās*, gen., or even *abhiśastipā́s* (cf. vs. 6),  
might be suggested as yet more probable.
