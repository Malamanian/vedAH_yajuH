## Translation
5. Whatever insulter of the gods, desirous of riches, not from  
knowledge, slays him, thinking him gentle, in his heart Indra kindles a  
fire; both the firmaments (*nábhas*) hate him as he goes about.

## Notes
Ppp. has in **a** *enām*, which is better. The *pada*-text absurdly  
reads *yé* instead of *yáḥ* at the beginning. The Anukr. seems to  
combine *ubhā́i ’nam* in **d**, as the meter demands, although *ubhé* is  
even a *pragṛhya;* part of the mss. (M.W.I.H.O.) read *ubhá e-*.
