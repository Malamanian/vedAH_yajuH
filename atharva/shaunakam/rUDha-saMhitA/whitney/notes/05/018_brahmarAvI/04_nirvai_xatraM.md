## Translation
4. Verily it conducts away his authority, smites his splendor; like fire  
taken hold of it burns up all; he who thinks the Brahman to be food, he  
drinks of Timātan poison.

## Notes
Or 'she' (the cow), or 'he' (the Brahman), instead of 'it,' in **a, b**.  
Ppp. reads in **b** *ālabdhaḥ pṛtannota rāṣṭaṁ*, and has a wholly  
different second half-verse, nearly agreeing with our 13 **c, d**: *yo  
brāhmaṇaṁ devabandhuṁ hinasti tasya pitṝṇām apy etu* *lokam*. The  
Anukr. reckons the verse unnecessarily as *bhurij*, since *iva* in **b**  
is to be shortened to *’va*.
