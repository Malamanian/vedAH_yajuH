## Translation
2. Thou here that makest all \[men\] yellow, heating (*śuc*) up like  
fire, consuming; now then, O fever—for mayest thou become sapless—now go  
away inward or downward.

## Notes
Or *nyàn̄* 'inward' is another 'downward.' The mss. mostly omit to double  
the *n̄* of *nyàn̄*, and several (P.M.W.H.) read *nyàn̄g;* P.M.W. have  
*adharā́g*. Ppp. has our vi. 20. 3 instead of this verse.
