## Translation
6. O fever, trickish one, speak out (?); O limbless one, keep much away  
(?); seek the fugitive (?) barbarian woman; make her meet a thunderbolt.

## Notes
Various points in this verse are very doubtful; in **a**, a vocative  
*vígada* seems much more probable, if only a suitable meaning could be  
found for it; and, if so, one may suspect the same character in  
*bhū́riyāvaya* (perhaps *bhūryāvaya* 'painful,' connected with *āvī*);  
the translation is mechanical, and follows the traditional text, since  
emendation yields so little satisfaction. Ppp. reads *vakada* for *vi  
gada*. In *niṣṭákvarīm* is doubtless to be seen a word-play on *takman*,  
but the sense is only conjectural; the word is quoted as an example  
under Prāt. ii. 85.
