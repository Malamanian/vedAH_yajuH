## Translation
4. I send \[him\] forth downward, having paid homage to the fever; let  
the fist-slayer of the dung-bearer (?) go back to the Mahāvrishas.

## Notes
Ludwig (and Grill after him) takes the obscure *śakambhará* in **c** as  
a proper name. We may conjecture that the Mahāvṛṣas are a neighboring  
tribe, looked down upon as gatherers of dung for fuel, on account of the  
lack of wood in their territory. Ppp. makes the meter of **b** easier by  
reading *kṛtvāya*.
