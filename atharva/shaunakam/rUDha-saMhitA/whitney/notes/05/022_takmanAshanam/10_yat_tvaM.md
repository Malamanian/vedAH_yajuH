## Translation
10. In that thou, being cold, then hot (*rūrá*), didst cause trembling,  
together with cough—fearful are thy missiles, O fever; with them do thou  
avoid us.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Ppp. begins with *yas* for *yat*, and leaves *atho* unelided in **a**.  
Most of our mss. have *tābhi sma* in **d**.
