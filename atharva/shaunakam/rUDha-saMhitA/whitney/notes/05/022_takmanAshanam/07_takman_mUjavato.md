## Translation
7. O fever, go to the Mūjavants, or to the Balhikas, further off; seek  
the wanton śūdra woman; her, O fever, do thou shake up a bit (*iva*).

## Notes
Some of our mss. (O.R.K.) read *tā́ṅs* in **d**, as if the word were  
*tā́n* instead of *tā́m*. Ppp. has *giriṁ gaccha girijā ’si rāutena māyuṣo  
gṛhāḥ; dāsīm ṛtyuccha prapharvyaṁ tāṅs takman nī ’va dhūnuhi*.
