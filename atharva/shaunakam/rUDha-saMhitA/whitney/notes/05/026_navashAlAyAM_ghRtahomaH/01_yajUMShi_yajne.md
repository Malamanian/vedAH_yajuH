## Translation
1. The sacrificial formulas (*yájus*) at the sacrifice, the fuel, hail!  
let Agni, foreknowing, here join for you.

## Notes
Or 'join (*yuj*) you.' 'Join' is probably used in the sense of 'duly use  
or apply' (Ludwig, "anwenden"). The verse is plainly composed of two  
*triṣṭubh* pādas, but the Anukr. refuses to resolve *suāhā*, and so  
reckons only 21 syllables.
