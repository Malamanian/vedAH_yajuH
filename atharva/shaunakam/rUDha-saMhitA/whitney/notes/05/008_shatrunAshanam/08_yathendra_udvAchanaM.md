title = "०८ यथेन्द्र उद्वाचनं"

## Translation
8. As Indra, taking Udvācana, put \[him\] underneath his feet, so do I  
put down them yonder, through everlasting (*śáśvat*) years (*sámā*).

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
*Udvā́cana* is heard of nowhere else, and the name looks so improbable  
that the Pet. Lexx. conjecture *udváñcana;* Ppp. has instead *udvātana;*  
it puts this verse at the end of the hymn. The redundancy of **d** is  
passed without notice by the Anukr.
