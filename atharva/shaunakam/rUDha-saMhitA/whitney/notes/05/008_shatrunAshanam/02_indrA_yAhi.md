## Translation
2. O Indra, come to my call; this will I do; that hear thou; let these  
over-runners (? *atisará*) of Indra's bring to pass (*sam-nam*) my  
design; by them may we be equal to (*śak*) heroism, O Jātavedas,  
self-controller.

## Notes
The obscure *atisará* is rendered etymologically, being found nowhere  
else; the Pet. Lex. conjectures "start, effort." For *idáṁ kariṣyāmi* in  
**b** is probably substituted in practical use a statement of the act  
performed. The Anukr. takes no notice of the redundant syllable in the  
pāda.
