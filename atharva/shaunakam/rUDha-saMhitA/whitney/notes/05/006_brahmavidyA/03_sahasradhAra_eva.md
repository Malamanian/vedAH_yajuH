## Translation
3. In the thousand-streamed one they resounded (*svar*) together, in the  
firmament (*nā́ka*) of the sky, they the honey-tongued, unhindered. His  
zealous (*bhū́rṇi*) spies wink not; in every place are they with fetters  
for tying.

## Notes
The verse is RV. ix. 73. 4, and is of mystic and obscure meaning. RV.  
reads *-dhāré ‘va* ⌊p. *-re áva* (for *-dhārāḥ iva?*) in **a**, *ásya*  
at beginning of **c**, and *sétavas* at end of **d**. Ppp. begins with  
*sahasram abhi te sam*.
