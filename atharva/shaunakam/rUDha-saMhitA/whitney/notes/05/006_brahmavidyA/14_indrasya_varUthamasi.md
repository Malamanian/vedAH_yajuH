title = "१४ इन्द्रस्य वरूथमसि"

+++
## Translation
14. Indra's guard (*várūtha*) art thou; to thee etc. etc.

## Notes
The accent-mark which belongs under *tvā* in 12 and 13 is omitted in our  
text, and in 14 it has slipped out of place and stands under *taṁ*. The  
metrical definition is worthless, though each of the four verses  
contains not far from 40 syllables.
