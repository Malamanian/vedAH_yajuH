title = "०२ यस्त्वा पिबति"

## Translation
2. He who drinketh thee liveth; thou rescuest a man (*púruṣa*); for thou  
art a sustainer (*bhartrī́*) of all, and a hiding-place (? *nyáñcanī*) of  
people.

## Notes
'Of all,' (*śaśvatām*, lit. 'of constant ones,' i.e. of as many as  
constantly come to thee. Ppp. reads *dhartrī ca* for *bhartrī hi* in  
**c**, and, for **d**, *śaśvatām bhyatvaṁcanī*.
