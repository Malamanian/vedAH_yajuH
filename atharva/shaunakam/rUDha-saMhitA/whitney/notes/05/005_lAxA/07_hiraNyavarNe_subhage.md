## Translation
7. Thou gold-colored, fortunate, vehement (? *śúṣmā*), hairy-bellied  
one—sister of the waters art thou, O *lākṣā;* the wind was thy soul.

## Notes
*Lākṣā* is not elsewhere met with as name or epithet of a plant: the  
Anukr. takes it as the principal name: *pūrveṇa* \[*sūktena*\] *lākṣām  
astāut*. Ppp. reads *yuvate* for *subhage* in **a**. ⌊Cf. Pischel, *Ved.  
Stud.* i. 178; Bloomfield, ZDMG. xlviii. 574.⌋
