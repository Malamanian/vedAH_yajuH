## Translation
6. Thou gold-colored, fortunate, sun-colored one, of most wondrous  
forms; mayest thou go to the hurt (? *rutá*), O relief; relief, verily,  
by name art thou.

## Notes
*Vapuṣṭame* (p. *vapuḥ-tame*) is quoted as an example under Prāt. ii.  
83. In **c**, P. reads *ruttám*, and H. (and Bp.?) *ṛtám;* it might be  
from root *ru* 'cry out': 'come to our call.' Ppp. reads at the  
beginning *hiraṇyabāhū*, and, for **d**, *se ’maṁ niṣkṛdhi pāuruṣam*  
(thus exchanging 4 **d** and 6 **d**).
