## Translation
1. Nine breaths with nine he combines (? *sam-mā*), in order to length  
of life for a hundred autumns; in the yellow (*hárita*), three; in  
silver, three; in iron (? *áyas*), three—enveloped with fervor.

## Notes
'Yellow,' doubtless 'gold.' Ppp. reads *rajasā* for *tapasā* in **d**.  
The second half-verse can hardly be called anything but prose, though  
the Anukr. takes it as good *triṣṭubh* meter. It appears doubtful  
whether this verse belongs with the rest, and whether the nine  
*prāṇagrahas*, or the nine verses of the *trivṛt stoma*, are not rather  
intended in it.
