## Translation
8. When the three eagles (*suparṇá*) went with the triple one, becoming,  
mighty ones (*śakrá*), a single syllable, they bore back death along  
with (*sākám*) the immortal, warding off (*antar-dhā*) all difficulties.

## Notes
'Warding off,' literally 'interposing \[something between\] themselves  
\[and\]'; 'along with,' doubtless = 'by means of' (cf. vii. 53. 1: xii.  
2. 29). 'Single syllable,' or 'the one indissoluble': probably the  
syllable *om* is intended.
