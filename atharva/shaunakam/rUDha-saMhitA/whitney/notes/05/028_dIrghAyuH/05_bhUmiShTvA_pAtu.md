## Translation
5. Let earth, the all-bearing, protect thee with the yellow one; let  
Agni rescue \[thee\] in accord with the iron; let the silver one  
(*árjuna*), in concord with the plants, bestow (*dhā*) on thee  
dexterity, with favoring mind.

## Notes
Ppp. reads in **c** *vīrudbhis te arjuno saṁ-*. The meter is like that  
of verse 4.
