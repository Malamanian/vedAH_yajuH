title = "१४ घृतादुल्लुप्तं मधुना"

## Translation
14. Snatched (*lup*) out of ghee, anointed over with honey, fixing the  
earth, unmoved, rescuing, splitting \[our\] rivals, and putting them  
down, do thou ascend me in order to great good-fortune.

## Notes
The verse agrees nearly with xix. 33. 2. The mss. read *bhindánt* (p.  
*bhindán*) for *bhindát* in **c**. A corresponding verse is found in a  
RV. *khila* to x. 128: *ghṛtād ulluptam madhumat suvarṇaṁ dhanaṁjayaṁ  
dharuṇaṁ dhārayiṣṇu: ṛṇak sapatnān adharāṅś ca kṛṇvad ā roha mām mahate  
sāubhagāya*. ⌊Given also by von Schroeder, *Tübinger Kaṭha-hss.*, p.  
36.⌋
