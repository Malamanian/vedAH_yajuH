## Translation
1. An eagle (*suparṇá*) discovered thee; a hog dug thee with his snout;  
seek thou to injure, O herb, him that seeks to injure; smite down the  
witchcraft-maker.

## Notes
We have had the first half-verse already, as ii. 27. 2 **a, b**. Ppp.  
has, for **d**, *prati kṛtyākṛto daha*.
