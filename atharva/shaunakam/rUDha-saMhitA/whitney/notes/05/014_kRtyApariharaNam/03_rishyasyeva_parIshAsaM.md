## Translation
3. Having cut around out of \[his\] skin a strip (*pariśāsá*), as it  
were of a stag, fasten, O gods, upon the witchcraft-maker the  
witchcraft, like a necklace.

## Notes
That is, apparently, with a thong cut out of his own skin, like a  
buck-skin thong. As usual, the mss. vary in **a** between *ṛ́śy-* and  
*ríśy-*, E. even reading *ríṣy-*, but the majority have *ṛ́śy-*, which  
is undoubtedly the true text, and should be restored in our edition.  
Three times, in this hymn (vss. 3, 5, 12), the Anukr. insists on  
regarding *iva* as dissyllabic, and therefore reckons the verses as  
*bhurij*.
