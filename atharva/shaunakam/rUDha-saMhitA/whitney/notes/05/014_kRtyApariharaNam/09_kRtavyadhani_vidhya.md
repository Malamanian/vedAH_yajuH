## Translation
9. O practiced piercer (?), pierce him; whoever made \[it\], him do thou  
smite; we do not sharpen thee up to slay (*vadhá*) him who has not made  
\[it\].

## Notes
This verse is found in Ppp. in book ii., much corrupted, with, for  
**d**, *vadhāya śaṁsamīmahe*. *Kṛtavyadhanī* may possibly be the proper  
name of the herb addressed: cf. *kṛtavedhana* or *-dhaka*, "name of a  
sort of fennel or anise" (Pet. Lex.).
