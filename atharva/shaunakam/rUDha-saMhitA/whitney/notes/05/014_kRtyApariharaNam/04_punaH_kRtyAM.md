title = "०४ पुनः कृत्यां"

## Translation
4. Lead thou away the witchcraft back to the witchcraft-maker, grasping  
its hand; set it straight before (*samakṣám*) him, that it may smite the  
witchcraft-maker.

## Notes
Ppp. has, for **b**, *pratiharaṇaṁ na harāmasi* (our 8 **c**); but in  
book ii. it has the whole half-verse just as it stands here.
