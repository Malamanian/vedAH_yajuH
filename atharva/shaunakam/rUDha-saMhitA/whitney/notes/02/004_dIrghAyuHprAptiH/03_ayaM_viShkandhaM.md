title = "०३ अयं विष्कन्धं"

## Translation
3. This one overpowers the *víṣkandha;* this drives off the devourers;  
let this *jan̄giḍá*, possessing all remedies, protect us from distress.

## Notes
The first half-verse we had above as i. 16. 3 **a, b**, with *idám* for  
*ayám.* Ppp. begins this time also with *idam*, has *sāte* (*māte?*) for  
*sahate*, and for **b** reads *ayaṁ rakṣo ’pa bādhate;* it gives  
*viṣkandham* with our text.
