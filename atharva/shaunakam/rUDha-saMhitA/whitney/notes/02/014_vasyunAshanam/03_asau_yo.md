## Translation
3. Yon house that is below—there let the hags be; there let debility  
(*sedí*) make its home (*ni-uc*), and all the sorceresses.

## Notes
Ppp. has a different version of the first three pādas: *amuṣminn adhare  
gṛhe sarvā svaṅta rāyaḥ: tatra pāpmā ni yacchatu.* The comm. renders  
*sedi* by *nirṛti.*  
  
⌊Our accent-notation does not here distinguish a *kṣāipra* circumflex  
(*ny-ùcyantu*) from an enclitic circumflex (*sedír nyùcyantu*—as if it  
were the impossible *ni-ucyantu*, accentless); nor do the mss. of SPP.:  
but in his text, he here employs the stroke, like "long ſ" or the sign  
of integration, which does distinguish them.⌋
