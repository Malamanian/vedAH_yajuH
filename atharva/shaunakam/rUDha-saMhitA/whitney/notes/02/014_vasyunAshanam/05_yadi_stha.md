## Translation
5. If ye are of the endemic (? *kṣetriyá*) ones, or if sent by men; if  
ye are born from the barbarians (*dásyu*)—disappear from here, O  
*sadā́nvās.*

## Notes
All the mss., both here and in the next verse, accent at the end  
*sadā́nvās*, though the word is plainly a vocative, and is so understood  
by the comm. (who says nothing of the accent, and indeed in general pays  
no heed to it); SPP. retains the manuscript reading. Ppp. has for **a**  
*yā devā gha kṣetriyād*, and for **c** *yad astu daśvibho jātā.*
