## Translation
7. Indra in the beginning, being pierced, created this refreshment,  
\[this\] unaging *svadhā́;* it is thine here; by it live thou for  
autumns, very splendid; be there no flux of thee; the healers have made  
\[it\] for thee.

## Notes
In **d**, *ā́ susrot* is here rendered as if it involved the idea of  
*āsrāva* 'flux'; the **d** seems to forbid its being taken to mean "let  
it not be spilled "; the comm., however, so understands it: *pracyuto mā  
bhūt.* Some of our mss. (M.P.W.) read *tváyā* at beginning of **c**. The  
comm. has *ūrjam* in **b**. Ppp. gives, in **a, b**, *viḍyo agram ūrjaṁ  
svadhām ajatām etam eṣā.*
