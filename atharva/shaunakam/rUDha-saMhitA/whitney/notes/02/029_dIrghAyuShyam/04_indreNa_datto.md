## Translation
4. Given by Indra, instructed by Varuṇa, sent forth by the Maruts, hath  
the formidable one come to us; let this man, in your lap, O  
heaven-and-earth, not hunger, not thirst.

## Notes
The "thirst" of the patient in Kāuś. has no more substantial foundation  
than the last two words of this verse. The text in Ppp. is defaced, but  
shows *sṛṣṭas* for *śiṣṭas* in **a**, and in **c, d**, after *-thivī,  
pari dadāmi sa mā.* The Anukr. would have us scan 11 + 11: 8 + 9 = 39,  
dividing before *upásthe;* but the *pada*-mss. mark the division  
correctly, after that word.
