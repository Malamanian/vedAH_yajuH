## Translation
2. Length of life to him assign thou, O Jātavedas; progeny, O Tvashṭar,  
do thou bestow on him; abundance of wealth, O Savitar ('impeller'), do  
thou impel to him; may he live a hundred autumns of thee.

## Notes
The construction of a dative with *adhi-ni-dhā* in **b** seems hardly  
admissible; BR. ⌊iii. 917⌋, in quoting the passage, reads *asmé*,  
apparently by an intended emendation, which, however, does not suit the  
connection; *asmín* is the only real help.
