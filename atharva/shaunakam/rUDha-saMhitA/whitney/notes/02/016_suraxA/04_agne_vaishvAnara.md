## Translation
4. O Agni Vāiśvānara, protect me with all the gods: hail!

## Notes
Ppp. makes, as it were, one verse out of our 4 and 5, by reading *agne  
viśvambhara viśvato mā pāhi svāhā.* The comm. gives several different  
explanations of *vāiśvānara* 'belonging to all men,' one of them as  
*viśvān-ara = jantūn praviṣṭaḥ!*
