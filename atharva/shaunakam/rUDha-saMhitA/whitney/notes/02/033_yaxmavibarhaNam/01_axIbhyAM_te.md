## Translation
1. Forth from thy (two) eyes, (two) nostrils, (two) ears, chin, brain,  
tongue, I eject (*vi-vṛh*) for thee the *yákṣma* of the head.

## Notes
The verse is RV. x. 163. i, without variant. Two or three of SPP's mss.,  
with the comm., read in **b** *cúbukāt;* MP. has *cibukāt* ⌊in the Whish  
ms.⌋; Ppp. substitutes for it *nāsyāt* (i.e. *āsyāt*), has *uta* for  
*ádhi*, and has for **d** *lalāṭād vi vayemasi.*
