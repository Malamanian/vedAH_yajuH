## Translation
3. The blood-drinking wizard, and whoso wants to take away fatness, the  
embryo-eating *káṇva* do thou make disappear, O spotted-leaf, and  
overpower.

## Notes
One or two of our mss. (W.I.), and several of SPP's, read in **b**  
*jíhīriṣati* ⌊I. has *-īrīṣ-*.⌋ Ppp. has at the end *sahasvatī.*
