## Translation
4. Make them enter the mountain, the life-obstructing (*-yopana*)  
*káṇvas;* do thou, O divine spotted-leaf, go burning after them like  
fire.

## Notes
⌊As to *kaṇvāṅ,* cf. i. 19. 4 n. As to *-yopana,* see Bloomfield, AJP.  
xii. 423.⌋ This verse and the next are too much defaced in Ppp. to admit  
comparison in detail; but its text differs somewhat from ours. The  
Anukr. refuses to sanction the common abbreviation to *agnir ’va* in  
**d.**
