## Translation
3. May this woman, O Agni, find a husband; for king Soma maketh her of  
good-fortune; giving birth to sons, she shall become chief consort  
(*máhiṣī*); having gone to a husband, let her, having good-fortune, bear  
rule (*vi-rāj*).

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Three mss. (including our P.O.) read *nā́ri* in **a**. ⌊For *videṣṭa* in  
**a** (*Grammar*² §850 a),⌋ Ppp. has *videṣṭu;* at end of **b** it reads  
*-gaṁ kṛṇotu;* and it changes the second half-verse into an address by  
reading *bhavāsi*, and *subhage vi rājā.* The comm. explains *mahiṣī* as  
*mahanīyā śreṣṭhā bhāryā.* The fourth pāda is best scanned as *jagatī*,  
with resolution *ga-tu-ā́* ⌊or insert *sā́* before *subhágā*⌋.
