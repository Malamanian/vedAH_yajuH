title = "०६ आ क्रन्दय"

## Translation
6. Shout to \[him\], O lord of riches; make a suitor hither-minded; turn  
the right side to every one who is a suitor according to thy wish.

## Notes
Circumambulation with the right side toward one is a sign of reverence.  
*Ā krandaya* in **a** is perhaps a real causative, 'make him call out to  
us'; the comm. takes it so. His explanation ⌊page 332⌋ of the  
accompanying rite is: "offering rice in the night, one should make the  
girl step forward to the right."
