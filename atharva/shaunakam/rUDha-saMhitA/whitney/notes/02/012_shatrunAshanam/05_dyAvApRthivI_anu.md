## Translation
5. O heaven-and-earth, attend (*ā-dīdhī*) ye after me; O all ye gods,  
take ye hold (*ā-rabh*) after me; O Angirases, Fathers, soma-feasting  
(*somyá*), let the doer of abhorrence (*apakāmá*) meet with (*ā-ṛ*)  
evil.

## Notes
Ppp. reads in **a** *dīdhyatām* ⌊cf. Bloomfield, AJP. xvii. 417⌋, and in  
**d** *pāpasāricchetv ap-*. The comm. does not recognize *dīdhī* as  
different from *dīdī*, rendering *ādīpte bhavatam.* ⌊In **a**, the  
accent-mark under *-vī* is missing.⌋
