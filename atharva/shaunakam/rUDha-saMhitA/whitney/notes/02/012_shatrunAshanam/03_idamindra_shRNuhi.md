## Translation
3. Hear this, O Indra, soma-drinker, as I call loudly to thee with a  
burning (*śuc*) heart; I hew (*vraśc*) him \[down\], as a tree with an  
ax, who injures this our mind.

## Notes
Or (in **b**) 'call repeatedly'; the comm. says *punaḥ punaḥ.* Ppp. has  
in **c** *vṛścāsi.* The comm. paraphrases *kuliśena* with *vajrasadṛśena  
paraśunā.* ⌊An orderly *triṣṭubh* is got by adding *tvám* after  
*somapa*.⌋
