## Translation
2. Hear this, O ye gods that are worshipful (*yajñíya*); Bharadvāja  
sings (*śaṅs*) hymns (*ukthá*) for me; let him, bound in a fetter, be  
plunged (*ni-yuj*) in difficulty who injures this our mind.

## Notes
That is, probably, our design or intent; the comm. says  
(inappropriately) *idam púrvaṁ sanmārgapravṛttam mānasam:* i.e. seduces  
us to evil courses. All the mss. chance to agree this time in omitting  
the visarga of *yajñíyāḥ* before *sthá* in **a**. But Ppp. reads *tu*  
instead of *stha*, and in **b** *uktyāni śaṅsatu*, as it often changes  
*-ti* to *-tu;* but here the imperative (or Weber's suggested *śaṅsat*)  
would improve the sense. ⌊Pronounce *devaāḥ* and reject *sthá;* the  
meter is then in order—12 + 12: 12 + 11.⌋
