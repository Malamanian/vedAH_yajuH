title = "०२ सुपर्णस्त्वान्वविन्दत् सूकरस्त्वाखनन्नसा"

## Translation
2. The eagle discovered (*anu-vid*) thee; the swine dug thee with his  
snout: smite the dispute etc. etc.

## Notes
Pāda **b** shows that the root is the part of the plant employed. If we  
struck off the impertinent refrain from vss. 2-5, and combined the lines  
into two verses, the hymn would conform to the norm of the second book  
(as in more than one case above ⌊p. 37⌋).
