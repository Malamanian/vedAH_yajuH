## Translation
3. Indra put (*kŗ*) thee on his arm, in order to lay low (*stŗ*) the  
Asuras: smite the dispute etc. etc.

## Notes
The comm., both here and in the next verse, understands *-bhya*(*ḥ*)  
*stárītave* as *-bhyas tárī-*, though he then explains *tarītave* by  
*starītum.* Pāda **a** is rendered in accordance with the comm. and with  
Weber; Grill, 'took thee into his arm.'
