## Translation
2. Both do thou become kindled, Agni, and do thou increase this man, and  
arise unto great good fortune; let not thine attendants (*upasattár*) be  
harmed, O Agni; be thy worshipers (*brahmán*) glorious, not others.

## Notes
The other texts are in accordance in reading *bodhaya* (for *vardhaya*)  
in **a**, and Ppp. nearly agrees with them, having *prati bodhaye ’nam;*  
for **c** the others give *mā́ ca riṣad upasattā́ te agne.*
