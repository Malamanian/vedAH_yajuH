title = "०२ अग्ने यत्"

## Translation
2. O Agni! with the rage (*háras*) that is thine, rage against him who  
hates us, whom we hate.

## Notes
*Práti hara* has to be strained in rendering, to preserve the  
parallelism of the expression. ⌊Or, 'with the seizing-force that is  
thine, force back him' etc.?⌋
