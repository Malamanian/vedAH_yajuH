## Translation
2. Touching the sky, worshipful, sun-skinned, deprecator of the seizure  
(*háras*) of the gods—gracious shall be the Gandharva, who is lord of  
being, the only one to receive homage, very propitious.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Ppp. begins with *diva spṛṣṭo*, and inverts the order of **c** and  
**d**. The comm. explains *sū́ryatvac* by *sūryasamānavarņa*, and *haras*  
by *krodha*. The Anukr. does not heed that **c** is a *jagatī* pāda.
