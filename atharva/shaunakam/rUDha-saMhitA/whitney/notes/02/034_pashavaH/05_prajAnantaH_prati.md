## Translation
5. Foreknowing, let them first (*pū́rva*) receive the breath (*prāṇá*)  
coming to \[them\] forth from the limbs. Go to heaven; stand firm with  
thy bodies; go to paradise (*svargá*) by god-traveled roads.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Ppp. has *devās* for *pūrve* in **a**, *tābhyām* for *divam* in **c**,  
and at the end *-bhiś śivebhiḥ.* TS. reads *gṛhṇanti* in **a**; and TS.  
K. MS. (ii. 5. 10 **c, d**) invert the order of **c** and **d**, and  
give the better reading *óṣadhīṣu* for *dívaṁ gacha* ⌊cf. RV. x. 16. 3⌋;  
MS. also has *hutás* for *svargam.* The comm. makes *pūrve* mean "the  
gods previously stationed in the atmosphere"; perhaps it is 'before the  
demons get hold of it.'
