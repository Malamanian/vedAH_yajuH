title = "०२ यश्च सापत्नः"

## Translation
2. Both the curse that is a rival's, and the curse that is a sister's,  
what a priest (? *brahmán*) from fury may curse—all that \[be\]  
underneath our feet.

## Notes
*Sāpatná* perhaps here 'of a fellow wife,' and *jāmyā́s* perhaps 'of a  
near female relative'; the comm. explains *jāmi* as "sister, but  
connoting one's fellows (*sahajāta*)."
