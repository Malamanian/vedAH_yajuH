## Translation
5. Let the curse go to the curser; our \[part\] is along with him that  
is friendly (*suhā́rd*); of the eye-conjurer (*-mántra*), the unfriendly,  
we crush in the ribs (*pṛṣṭí*).

## Notes
Nearly all our mss. (except P.M.K.), and part of SPP's, read in **b**  
*suhā́t;* many also have in **d** *pṛṣṭhī́s*, but the distinction of *ṣṭ*  
and *ṣṭh* is not clearly made in any of the mss. The comm. takes  
*cakṣus* and *mantrasya* in **c** as two independent words. ⌊See  
Griflith's note, and mine to xix. 45. 2.⌋
