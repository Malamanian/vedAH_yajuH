## Translation
3. Weal to thee may the wind in the atmosphere bestow (*dhā*) vigor;  
weal to thee be the four directions: so from *kṣetriyá*, etc. etc.

## Notes
TB. HGS. have for **a** *śám antárikṣaṁ sahá vī́tena te;* Ppp. differs by  
reading *sahavātam astu te;* the two former, in **b**, put *bhavantu*  
last. The comm. has in **a** ⌊for *váyo dhāt*⌋ the better reading  
*vayodhās*, but he makes it mean "sustainer of birds"! ⌊'Weal to thee  
\[be\] the wind in the atmosphere, the vigor-bestower.'⌋
