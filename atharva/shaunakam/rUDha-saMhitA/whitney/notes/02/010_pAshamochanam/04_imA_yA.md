## Translation
4. These four heavenly (*devá*) directions, having the wind as lord,  
upon which the sun looks out—so from *kṣetriyá*, etc. etc.

## Notes
TB. HGS. (4. 1) have for **a** *yā́ dāívīś cátasraḥ pradíśaḥ;* Ppp. also  
omits *imā́s*, and combines *devīṣ pra-*, combining the pāda immediately  
with our 3 **b**. HGS. makes one verse of our 4 **a, b** and 5 **a, b**,  
and puts it in 4, after all the rest.
