title = "०७ अहा अरातिमविदः"

## Translation
7. Thou hast left niggardy, hast found what is pleasant; thou hast come  
to be in the excellent world of what is well done: so from *kṣetriyá*,  
etc. etc.

## Notes
Nearly all the *saṁhitā*-mss. omit the final visarga of *ávidaḥ* before  
*syonám*. The comm. reads *abhūt* in **b**; TB. does the same, and,  
correspondingly, *ávidat* in **a**, with *ávartim* (better ⌊cf. iv. 34.  
3; x. 2. 10⌋) for *ārātim*. The comment to Prāt. ii. 46 quotes *ahās* in  
this verse as not *ahār*, i.e. as from *hā*, not *hṛ.*
