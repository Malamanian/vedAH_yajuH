title = "०१ क्षेत्रियात् त्वा"

## Translation
1. From *kṣetriyá*, from perdition, from imprecation of sisters  
(*jāmí-*), from hatred (*drúh*) do I release thee, from Varuṇa's fetter;  
free from guilt (*-ā́gas*) I make thee by \[my\] incantation; be  
heaven-and-earth both propitious to thee.

## Notes
TB. HGS. have for **a** only *kṣetriyāí tvā nírṛtyāi tvā*, in **c**  
*bráhmaṇe* and *karomi*, and in **d** *imé* instead of *stām.* Ppp. has  
at the end *-thivī ’ha bhūtām.*
