## Translation
1. Let this Indra, well-saving, well-aiding, keep far away apart from us  
any hatred; may we be in the favor of him the worshipful, also in his  
excellent well-willing.

## Notes
The other texts (see under the preceding hymn) invert the order of the  
two half-verses, and all but MS. read *asmé* at end of (our) **a**. The  
*saṁhitā*-reading *sanutár* is prescribed by Prāt. ii. 48. The comm.  
explains the word as = *tirohitān* or *gūḍhān*.
