## Translation
6. Be ye just here; go not after; adorn yourselves with all forms; I  
shall come along with what is excellent; become ye more abundant through  
me.

## Notes
'Go not after': that is, 'do not follow me as I go away' (so the comm.).  
The verse is used in Kāuś. (23. 6) in the ceremony of house-building, on  
the breaking of previous silence; and again (24. 16), in a rite for  
prosperity, by one setting out on a journey, contemplating the house and  
its occupants.
