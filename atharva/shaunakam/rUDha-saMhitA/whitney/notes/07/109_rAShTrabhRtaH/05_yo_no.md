## Translation
5. He who made this riches for our playing, who the taking (?) and  
leaving of the dice—that god, enjoying this libation of ours—may we  
revel a joint reveling with the Gandharvas.

## Notes
The Ppp. version is quite different: *yo no devo dhanam idaṁ dideśa yo  
‘kṣāṇāṁ grahaṇaṁ śaṣaṇaṁ ca: sa no ’vatu havir* etc.; also *gandharvāis  
sadh-* in **d**. The comm. explains *gláhanam* and *śéṣaṇam*  
respectively by *grahaṇa¿m svakīyāir akṣāir jitvā svīkaraṇam*, and  
*svīyānām akṣāṇāṁ jayāhvasthāne* (one ms. *-yāṅhva-*) ‘*vaśeṣaṇam*.
