## Translation
3. The Apsarases revel a joint reveling, between the oblation-holder  
(*havirdhā́na*) and the sun; let them unite my hands with ghee; let them  
make the rival gambler subject to me.

## Notes
Ppp. begins *yā ’ps-* puts *antarā* first in **b**, reads in **c** *tā  
nāu* ⌊intending *no*?⌋ *hastaṁ kṛtena* (this is a great improvement)  
*saṁ sṛ-*, and has *naṛ kit-* in **d**. The comm. understands  
*havirdhāna* in **b** to signify the earth. The first half-verse is  
identical with xiv. 2. 34 **a, b**.
