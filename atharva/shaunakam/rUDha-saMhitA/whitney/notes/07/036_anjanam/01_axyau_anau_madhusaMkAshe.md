## Translation
1. The eyes of us two \[be\] of honey-aspect; our face \[be\] ointment;  
put (*kṛ*) thou me within thy heart; may our mind verily be together.

## Notes
The comm. begins with *aksāu*, and Ppp. also reads the same. The  
*pada*-text divides *sahā́ ’sati* into *sahā́: ásati*, which is plainly  
wrong (should be *asati*).
