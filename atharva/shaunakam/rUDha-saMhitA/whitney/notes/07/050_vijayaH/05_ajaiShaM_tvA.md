## Translation
5. I have won of thee what is scored together (?); I have won also the  
check (?); as a wolf might shake a sheep, so I shake thy winnings.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
*Saṁlikhitam* and *saṁrudh* are technical terms, obscure to us. The  
comm. ingeniously states that players sometimes stop or check  
(*saṁrudh*) an antagonist by marks (*an̄ka*) which they make with slivers  
of dice and the like, and that such marks and the one who checks by  
means of them are intended—a pretty evident fabrication. Ppp. reads  
*saṁvṛtam* instead of *saṁrudham;* the comm. explains the latter word  
simply by *saṁroddhāram*.
