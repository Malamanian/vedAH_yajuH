## Translation
1. The Rudra that is in the fire (*agní*), that is within the waters,  
that entered the herbs, the plants, that shaped (*kḷp*) all these  
beings—to that Rudra, to Agni, be homage.

## Notes
TS., at V. 5. 9³, has a nearly corresponding address, but making no  
pretense to a metrical character: it reads *yó rudró agnāú* (so far,  
Ppp. agrees) *yó apsú yá óṣadīṣu* *yó rudró víśvā bhúvanā ”vivéśa  
tásmāi rudrā́ya námo astu;* thus omitting the perplexing *agnaye* at the  
end, for which Ppp. also has the better reading *adya*. The comm.  
explains *cākḷpe* by (*sraṣṭuṁ*) *samartho bhavati*. Pāda **b** is  
*triṣṭubh;* ⌊but **a** is not to be made good by pronouncing *rudró* as  
a trisyllable⌋.
