## Translation
1. Rich in progeny, shining in good pasture, drinking clear waters at a  
good watering-place—let not the thief master you, nor the evil-plotter;  
let Rudra's weapon avoid you.

## Notes
Repeated here from iv. 21. 7; for the parallel passages with their  
variants etc., see the note to that verse.
