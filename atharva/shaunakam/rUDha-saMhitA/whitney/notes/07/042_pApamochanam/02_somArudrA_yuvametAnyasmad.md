## Translation
2. O Soma-and-Rudra, do ye put all these remedies in our bodies; untie,  
loosen from us what committed sin may be bound in our bodies.

## Notes
Found also in RV. (vi. 74. 3), TS.MS. (as above) ⌊TS. *yúvam*, by  
misprint⌋; all read *asmé* for the ungrammatical *asmát* in **a**, and  
the translation follows them; and they have *ásti* for *ásat* in **c**.
