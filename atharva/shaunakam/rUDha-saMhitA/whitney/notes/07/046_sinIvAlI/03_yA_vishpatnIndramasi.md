title = "०३ या विश्पत्नीन्द्रमसि"

## Translation
3. Who, mistress of the people, art a match for (? *pratī́cī*) Indra,  
the thousand-braided goddess coming on, to thee, O spouse of Vishṇu, are  
the oblations given; stir up thy husband, O goddess, unto bestowal.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *viśvatas* (for *viśpatnī*) in **a**, *sahasrastutā* in  
**b**, and *rādhasā* in **d**. Henry acutely points out that this verse  
probably belongs to Anumati, who is else left unaddressed in this group  
of hymns to the lunar deities, and that its description applies best to  
her.
