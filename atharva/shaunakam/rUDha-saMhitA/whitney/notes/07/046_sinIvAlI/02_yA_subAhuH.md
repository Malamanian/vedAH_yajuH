## Translation
2. She that is of good arms, of good fingers, bearing well, giving birth  
to many—to that Sinīvālī, mistress of the people, offer ye oblation.

## Notes
The verse is RV. ii. 32. 7, without variant (also TS.MS., as above, both  
with *supāṇís* for *subāhús*). Ppp. reads in **a, b** *suman̄galis  
suṣumā*.
