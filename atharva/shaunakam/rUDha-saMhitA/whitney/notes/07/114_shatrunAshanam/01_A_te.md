title = "०१ आ ते"

## Translation
1. I take from thy entrails (*vakṣáṇā*), I take from thy heart, from the  
aspect of thy face, I take all thy splendor.

## Notes
Ppp. has, for **b**, *ā dade hṛdayād adhi*, and, for the second  
half-verse, *ā te mukhasya yad varca āśaṁ mā abhyatṛpsasi*. The comm.  
says *ūrusaṁdhir van̄kṣaṇa ity ucyate;* or, alternatively, the *vakṣaṇās*  
are *kaṭivikaṭyūrupādāḥ*. This verse appears to belong properly with  
hymn 113, as vs. 2 with 115.
