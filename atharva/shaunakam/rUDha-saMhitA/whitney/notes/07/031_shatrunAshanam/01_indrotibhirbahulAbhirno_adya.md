## Translation
1. O Indra, with abundant best possible aids, O generous hero, quicken  
us today; whoever hates us, may he fall downward; and whom we hate, him  
let breath quit.

## Notes
The verse is RV. iii. 53. 21, which has for sole variant  
*yācchreṣṭhā́bhis* ⌊which the meter alone would suggest as an emendation⌋  
(p. *yāt॰śre-*) in **b**. The combination *sás padīṣṭa* is prescribed by  
Prāt. ii. 58. The comm. treats *yāvat* and *śreṣṭhābhis* as independent  
words.
