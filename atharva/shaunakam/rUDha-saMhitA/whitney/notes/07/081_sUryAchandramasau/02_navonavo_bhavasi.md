## Translation
2. Ever new art thou, being born; sign (*ketú*) of the days, thou goest  
to the apex (*ágra*) of the dawns; thou disposest their share to the  
gods as thou comest; thou stretchest out, O moon, a long life-time.

## Notes
In RV. and MS. (as above), and TS. ii. 4. 14¹, the four verbs are in the  
third person, and we have *candrámās* nom. in **d**. Further, TS. reads  
*ágre* at end of **b**, and *tirati* in **d**. The application of **b**  
to the moon is obscure. The absence of any allusion to the asterisms is  
not without significance. ⌊Over "stretchest" W. interlines "extendest."⌋  
⌊Vss. 1-2 are repeated below as xiv. i. 23-24.⌋
