## Translation
1. O Brihaspati, Savitar, increase thou him; enlighten him unto great  
good-fortune; however sharpened, sharpen him further; let all the gods  
revel after him.

## Notes
The other texts make **b** and **c** exchange places; in **a**, they  
read *savitar* without accent (as does also the comm.; it suits better  
with the singular verbs that follow), and *bodháya* for *vardháya;* in  
(our) **b**, they give *vardháya* for *jyotáya* (the comm. *dyotaya*);  
in (our) **c**, VS.TS. read *saṁtarā́m;* in **d**, MS. inserts *ca* after  
*víśve*.
