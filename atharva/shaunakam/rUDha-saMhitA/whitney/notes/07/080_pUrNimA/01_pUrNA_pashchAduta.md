## Translation
1. Full behind, also full in front, up from the middle hath she of the  
full moon been victorious; in her, dwelling together with the gods, with  
greatness, may we revel together with food (*íṣ*) on the back of the  
firmament.

## Notes
The first half-verse is met with in TS. (iii. 5. 1¹) and TB. (iii. 1.  
1¹²), without variant; the second half-verse reads thus: *tásyāṁ devā́  
ádhi saṁvásanta uttamé nā́ka ihá mādayantām*. Ppp., in **b**, puts  
*pāurṇamāsi* before *madhyatas* ⌊and ends **b** with *uj jigāya*⌋.
