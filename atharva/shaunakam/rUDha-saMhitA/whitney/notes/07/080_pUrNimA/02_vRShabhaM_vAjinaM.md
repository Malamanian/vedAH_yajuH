## Translation
2. We sacrifice to the vigorous bull of the full moon; let him give us  
unexhausted unfailing wealth.

## Notes
The first half-verse occurs in TB. (iii. 7. 5¹³) and ĀpśS. (ii. 20. 5),  
both of which read *ṛṣabhám* and *pūrṇámāsam;* their second half-verse  
reads thus: *sá no dohatāṁ suvī́ryaṁ rāyáspóṣaṁ sahasríṇam*. The comm.  
reads *dadhātu* in **c**.
