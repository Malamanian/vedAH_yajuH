## Translation
1. From the cross-lined \[snake\], from the black snake, from the adder  
(*pṛ́dāku*) \[what is\] gathered—that poison of the heron-jointed (?) one  
hath this plant made to disappear.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *an̄gaparvaṇas* in **c**; the comm. says simply *etannāmakād  
daṅśakaviśeṣāt*. According to the comm., the plant intended is the  
*madhuka* (or *-kā*), which is the name of various trees and herbs.
