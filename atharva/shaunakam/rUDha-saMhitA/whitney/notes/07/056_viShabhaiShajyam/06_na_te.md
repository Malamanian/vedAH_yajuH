## Translation
6. Not in thy (two) arms is there strength, not in thy head, nor in thy  
middle; then what petty thing bearest thou in that evil way in thy tail?

## Notes
Or *kim* may be 'why?' (so the comm.) instead of 'what?' In this verse  
the comm. regards a ⌊*pucchena*⌋ *daṅśī vṛścikaḥ* as the thing  
addressed. *Amuyā́* is an adverb of disgust or contempt; *pāpáyā* here  
apparently intensifies it.
