## Translation
8. Thou that strikest (*pra-hṛ*) with both, with both tail and mouth—in  
thy mouth is no poison; how then may there be in thy tail-receptacle?

## Notes
Or, again, 'what may there' etc. The last two verses lack each a  
syllable, unheeded by the Anukr. The comm. this time once more declares  
a scorpion (*vṛścika*) intended; *pucchadhi*, according to him,  
designates a *romavān avayavaḥ*. ⌊Ppp. has for **c** *āsye cana te  
viṣaṁ*.⌋
