## Translation
2. The ruddy one sent together the collected dawns, faultless,  
like-minded, most-furious, in the gathered stall of the cow.

## Notes
Even to make a mechanical version it has been necessary to read  
*āirayat*, with SV., which has further, at the end, *manyumántaś citā́  
góḥ;* Ppp. gives *īraya*, and *citayo goḥ*.  
  
The second *anuvāka*, ending here, has 9 hymns and 22 verses; the Anukr.  
quotation says *dve dvitīye tu vidyāt*.  
  
⌊In the head-line of p. 150 of the Berlin edition, correct the  
misprinted *kāṇḍa*-number 6 to 7.⌋
