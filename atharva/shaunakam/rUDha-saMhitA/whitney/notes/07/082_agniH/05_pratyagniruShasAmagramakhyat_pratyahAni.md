## Translation
5. Agni hath looked forth to meet the apex of the dawns, to meet the  
days, \[he\] first, Jātavedas, and to meet the rays of the sun in many  
places; to meet heaven-and-earth he stretched out.

## Notes
A variation of the preceding verse, perhaps suggested by RV. iv. 13. 1  
**a**, which is identical with its first pāda; its second half agrees  
much more closely with the version of the other texts than does 4 **c,  
d**. The comm. is still more faithful to that version, by giving the  
(preferable) reading *purutrā* in **c**.
