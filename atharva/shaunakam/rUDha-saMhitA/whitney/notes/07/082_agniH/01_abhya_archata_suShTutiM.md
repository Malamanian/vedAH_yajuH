## Translation
1. Sing (*arc*) ye good praise unto the contest for kine; put ye in us  
excellent possessions; lead ye this sacrifice of ours unto the gods; let  
streams of ghee purify themselves sweetly.

## Notes
The verse is found also as RV. iv. 58. 10 and VS. xvii. 98. Both read in  
**a** *arṣata* (which is better), and at the the *pavante*. The comm.  
understands *devatās* in **c**. He regards the waters or the kine as  
addressed, and explains **a** in several different ways.
