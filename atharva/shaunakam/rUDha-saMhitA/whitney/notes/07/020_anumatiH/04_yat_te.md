## Translation
4. The easily-invoked, approved, generous (*sudā́nu*) name that is  
thine, O well-conducting Anumati—therewith fill our sacrifice, O thou of  
all choice things; assign us, O fortunate one, wealth rich in heroes.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *sudāvas* at end of **b**, and has a wholly different second  
half-verse: *tena tvaṁ sumatiṁ devy asma iṣaṁ pinva viśvavāraṁ suvīram*.  
The last half-verse is repeated below as 79. 1 **c, d**. ⌊In **c**, *no*  
is superfluous.⌋
