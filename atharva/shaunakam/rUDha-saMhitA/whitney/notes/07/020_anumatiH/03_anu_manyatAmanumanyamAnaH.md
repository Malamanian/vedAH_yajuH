## Translation
3. Let him, approving, approve wealth rich in progeny, not being  
exhausted; let us not come to be within his wrath; may we be in his very  
gracious favor.

## Notes
The first three pādas correspond to that part of a verse in TS. iii. 3.  
11⁴ (to which the comm., by an almost isolated proceeding, refers, with  
notice of the differences of reading) which preserves the consistency of  
the hymn by reading the feminines, *-mānā* at end of **a**, and *tásyāi*  
in **c**; Ppp. apparently intends the same with *-mānāṣ* and *tasyā*,  
and it further agrees with TS. in giving, for **d**, *sā no devī suhavā  
śarma yachatu*. The change of our text to masculines seems a mere  
corruption. Our **d** is nearly RV. viii. 48. 12 **d**.
