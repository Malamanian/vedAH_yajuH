## Translation
2. Rough art thou, a rough one; poisonous, a poisonous one art  
thou;—that thou mayest be avoided, as a barren cow (? *vaśā́*) of a bull.

## Notes
The first part in Ppp. reads: *triṣṭā ’si triṣṭakā ’si vṛṣā vṛṣātaky  
asi*. The comm. tries to find root *tañc* + *ā* in *viṣātakī́* (= *viṣam  
ātan̄kayati*); *vaśā* he paraphrases with *-vandhyā gāuḥ*. The verse is  
rather *kakummatī* than *śan̄kumatī*. ⌊It becomes a perfectly regular  
*anuṣṭubh* if we add at the end of **a** (with Ppp.) an *asi*.⌋
