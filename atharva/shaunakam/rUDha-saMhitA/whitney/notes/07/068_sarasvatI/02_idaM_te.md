## Translation
2. This \[is\] thine oblation, rich in ghee, O Sarasvatī; this the  
oblation of the Fathers that is to be consumed (?); these thy most  
wealful utterances; by them may we be rich in sweet.

## Notes
The translation implies the emendation of *āsyàm* in **c** to *āśyàm;*  
the comm. makes it from the root as 'throw,' and = *kṣepanīyam*. Perhaps  
(Roth) *ājyam* is the true reading; Henry understands *yát* as pple:  
"going to the mouth of the Fathers." The first pāda is *jagatī*.
