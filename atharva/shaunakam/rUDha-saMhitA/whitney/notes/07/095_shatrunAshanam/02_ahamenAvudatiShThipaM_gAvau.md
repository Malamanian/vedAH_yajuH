## Translation
2. I have made them (dual) rise up, like (two) weary-sitting kine, like  
(two) growling dogs, like (two) lurking (? *ud-av*) wolves.

## Notes
The comm. explains *udavantāu* by *goyūthamadhye vatsān udgṛhya  
gacchantāu;* Henry renders "that watch one another." ⌊He would reject  
*úd* in **a**.⌋
