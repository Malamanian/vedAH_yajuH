## Translation
1. Ye much-heating (*sāṁtapaná*) ones, here \[is\] oblation; enjoy that,  
ye Maruts; with favor to us, O foe-destroyers (? *riśā́das*).

## Notes
This verse and the next following are two successive RV. verses (in  
inverted order, vii. 59. 9, 8), and are also found together (in the AV.  
order) in MS. (iv. 10. 5), and, with our verse 3 added, in TS. (iv. 3.  
13³⁻⁴). The other texts all have *yuṣmā́ka* for *asmā́ka* in **c**. The  
warming winds after the cold season are probably intended by the  
*sāṁtapana* Maruts.
