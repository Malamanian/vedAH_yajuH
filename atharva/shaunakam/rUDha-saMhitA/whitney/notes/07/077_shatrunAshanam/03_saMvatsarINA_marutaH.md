## Translation
3. The Maruts, of the year, well-singing, wide-dwelling, troop-attended,  
humane (*mā́nuṣa*)—let them release from us the fetters of sin, they the  
much-heating, jovial, reveling.

## Notes
T.S., in **b**, accents *urukṣáyās* and reads *mā́nuṣeṣu* (which is  
better); in **c** it combines *tè ‘smát* and reads *āṅhasas* (for  
*énasas*); in **d** it has *madirā́s* (for *matsarā́s*). Ppp. gives, in  
**c**, *pāśān prati muñcantu sarvān*. The comm. explains *saṁvatsarīnās*  
by *varṣevarṣe prādurbhaviṣyantaḥ*. This "*jagatī*" is half *triṣṭubh*.
