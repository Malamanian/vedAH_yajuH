## Translation
1. Let Indra be well-saving, well-aiding with aids, very gracious,  
all-possessing; let him put down (*bādh*) hatred, let him make for us  
fearlessness; may we be lords of wealth in heroes.

## Notes
This hymn and the following are two successive verses in RV. (x. 131. 6,  
7, or vi. 47. 12, 13), and are also found together in VS. (xx. 51, 52),  
TS. (i. 7. 13⁴⁻⁵), and MS. (iv. 12. 5). All these agree in leaving out  
the *nas* which disturbs the meter of **c**. Our *pada*-text agrees with  
that of RV. in both verses in falsely dividing *svá॰vān*, and the comm.  
explains the word correspondingly with *dhanavān hitātmā vā*.
