## Translation
1. Across wastes, across waters penetrated the men-beholding falcon,  
seeing a resting-place; passing all the lower spaces, may he come  
hither, propitious, with Indra as companion.

## Notes
Ppp. combines (as often) *-kṣā ’vasāna-* in **b**, and *śivā ”jagāma* in  
**d**. *Avasāna-*, either 'his goal' (so Henry) or 'the settlements of  
men.' The meter is pure *triṣṭubh*.
