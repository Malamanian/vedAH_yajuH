## Translation
1. What Indra dug for us, what Agni, all the gods, what the well-singing  
Maruts—that may Savitar of true ordinances, may Prajāpati, may Anumati  
confirm to us.

## Notes
The comm. reads *asanat* (= *adadāt*) in **a**, and so do our Bp.I. (E.  
*aṣanat* p.m.), although SPP. reports no such variant among his  
authorities.
