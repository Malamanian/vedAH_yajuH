## Translation
2. O Indra-and-Varuṇa, of the bull soma, most rich in sweet, pour in, ye  
bulls; here is your beverage (*ándhas*), poured about; sitting on this  
*barhís*, do ye revel.

## Notes
RV. fills out the meter and sense of **c** by adding at the end *asmé*  
(the Anukr. ignores the deficiency), and Ppp. seems to read *idaṁ vām  
asme pariṣiktam andhā ”sad-* etc.; it also has *vṛṣetā* at end of **b**.  
The comm. explains *ā vṛṣethām* by *āśnītam*, quoting śB. ii. 4. 2. 20  
as authority.
