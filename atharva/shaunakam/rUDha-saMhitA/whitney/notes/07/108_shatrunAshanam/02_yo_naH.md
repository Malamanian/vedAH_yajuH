## Translation
2. Whoever shall assail us asleep or waking, standing or moving, O  
Jātavedas, in accord with Vāiśvānara as ally, do thou meet and burn them  
out, O Jātavedas.

## Notes
All SPP's *pada*-mss., and one of ours (D.), read *suptā́m* in **a**, by  
a frequent error. Ludwig suggests *vāivasvatena* for *vāiśvānareṇa* in  
**c**; it would certainly be an improvement to the sense.
