## Translation
4. Let Pūshan place about his right hand in front; let him drive back to  
us what is lost; may we be united with what is lost.

## Notes
The first three pādas of the verse are RV. vi. 54. 10, which differs  
only by reading *parástāt* instead of *pur-*. SPP., having the comm. and  
three of his (thirteen) authorities to support it, wrongly receives  
*parástāt* into his text. ⌊Pāda **a** is catalectic.⌋ ⌊Ppp's **c** is  
unintelligible; its **d** is *punar ṇo naṣṭam ā kṛdhi*.⌋
