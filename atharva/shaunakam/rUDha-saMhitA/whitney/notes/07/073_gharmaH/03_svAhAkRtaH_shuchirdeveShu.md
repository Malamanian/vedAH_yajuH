## Translation
3. The bright (*śúci*) sacrifice to the gods accompanied with "hail,"  
the Aśvins' bowl that is for the gods to drink of—this all the  
immortals, enjoying, lick respectively by the Gandharva's mouth.

## Notes
The two Sūtras and Ppp. agree in reading *gharmas* for *yajñas* in  
**a**; the former have also *īm* for *u* in **c**. The comm. declares  
this verse to be used after the *gharma* offering; the "bowl" is the one  
called *upayamana;* the "Gandharva" is either the sun or the fire.
