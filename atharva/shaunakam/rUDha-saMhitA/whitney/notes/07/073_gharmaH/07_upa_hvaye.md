## Translation
7. I call upon that easy-milking milch-cow; a skilful-handed milker also  
shall milk her; may the impeller (*savitár*) impel us the best impulse;  
the hot drink is kindled upon—that may he kindly proclaim.

## Notes
This and the following verse are also two successive verses in RV. (i.  
164. 26, 27; they are repeated below as ix. 10. 4, 5, where the whole  
RV. hymn is given). RV. has at the end the better reading *vocam*. The  
comm. declares the verse to be used in the calling up of the cow that  
furnishes the *gharma* drink, that she may be milked.
