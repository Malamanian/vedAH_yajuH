## Translation
4. Do thou, O lord of vows, adorned by the vow, shine here always,  
well-willing; thee being so kindled, O Jātavedas, may we all, rich in  
progeny, wait upon (*upa-sad*).

## Notes
Nearly all the mss. (our Bp.E.p.m. are exceptions, with four of SPP's  
authorities) read *tvā́m* in **a**, and so do the mss. of the *Kāuśika*  
⌊save Ch.Bū.⌋ and Vāitāna Sūtras in the *pratīka;* both printed texts  
give *tvám* ⌊with the comm.⌋. His full exposition of his uncertainty as  
to the meaning of *jātavedas* may be quoted: *jātānām bhūtānāṁ veditar  
jātāir vidyamāna jñāyamāna vā jātaprajña jātadhana vā*. The definition  
of the verse as *triṣṭubh* is lacking in the Anukr.
