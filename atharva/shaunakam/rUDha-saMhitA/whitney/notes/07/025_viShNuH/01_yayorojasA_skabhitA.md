## Translation
1. By whose ⌊du.⌋ force were established the spaces (*rájas*), who by  
heroisms are most heroic, most mighty, who by their powers lord it  
unopposed—to Vishṇu, to Varuṇa hath gone the first invocation.

## Notes
The verse is found also in a number of other texts: VS. (viii. 59), TB.  
(ii. 8. 4⁵), MS. (iv. 14. 6), SB. (i. 5), AśS. (v. 20. 6), śśS. (iii.  
20. 4); all of them agree nearly in their variations from our text:  
thus, *vīryèbhir* (but MS. *vīrébhir*) for *yāú vīryāìr* in **b**; *yā́*  
and *ápratītā* (but TB. *-tīttā*) in **c**; and *víṣṇū*, *váruṇā*, and  
*pūrváhūtāu* (but MS. *-tim*) in **d**; TB. further *śáciṣṭhā* in **b**.  
Ppp. has *stabhitā* in **a**, and *śacībhiḥ* (for *śaviṣṭhā*) in **b**.
