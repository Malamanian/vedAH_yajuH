## Translation
2. In whose (sing.) direction is whatever shines out here, \[whatever\]  
both breathes forth and looks abroad mightily (*śácībhis*), of old, by  
the god's ordinance, with powers (*sáhas*)—to Vishṇu, to Varuṇa hath  
gone the first invocation.

## Notes
The first pāda is found above as iv. 23. 7 **a**, and nearly as iv. 28.  
1 **b**; also in TS. iii. 3. 11⁴. Ppp. reads, for **c**, *maho\* ṛtasya  
dharmaṇā yuvānā*, and begins with *yayos*. The comm., in **b**, seems to  
give *prā ’niti ca*. The first pāda is rather *jagatī*. \*⌊So Roth's  
collation: his notes give *mahā*.⌋
