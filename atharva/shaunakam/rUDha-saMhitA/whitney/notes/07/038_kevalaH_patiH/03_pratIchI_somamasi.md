## Translation
3. Correspondent (*pratī́cī*) to Soma art thou, correspondent also to the  
sun, correspondent to all the gods; as such we address ⌊*acha-ā-vad*⌋  
thee.

## Notes
'Correspondent,' perhaps 'a match for, as effective as'; Henry  
translates: "looking in the face." The comm. declares the plant  
*śan̄khapuṣpī* to be addressed in the verse, and paraphrases *pratīcī* by  
*vaśīkaraṇārtham pratyag-añcanā*. Ppp. inserts *oṣadhe* at end of **a**,  
and reads *anu* for *uta* in **b**. The verse admits of being read,  
artificially, as 7 × 4 = 28.
