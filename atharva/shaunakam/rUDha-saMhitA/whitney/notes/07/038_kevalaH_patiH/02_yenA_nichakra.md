## Translation
2. Wherewith the Āsurī put down Indra from among the gods, therewith put  
I thee down, that I may be very dear ⌊fem.!⌋ to thee.

## Notes
The comm. explains *āsurī* alternatively as *asurasya māyā*, and renders  
*ni cakre* by *yuddhe svādhīnaṁ kṛtavatī*. ⌊Weber, Henry, and Bloomfield  
understand this vs. as relating to Indra's seduction by an *āsurī:* cf.  
Oertel, JAOS. xix². 120.⌋ ⌊Ppp. corrupt, as noted above.⌋
