title = "०१ राकामहं सुहवा"

## Translation
1. Rākā I call with good call, with good praise; let the fortunate one  
hear us; let her willingly note; let her sew the work with a needle that  
does not come apart; let her give a hero of hundred-fold value, worthy  
of praise.

## Notes
The other texts agree throughout,\* and differ from ours only by reading  
in **a** *suhávām*, which Ppp. also has, and the comm. The latter  
explains Rākā as *sampūrṇacandrā pāurṇamāsi*. ⌊Our **d** repeats 47. 1  
**d**.⌋ \*⌊But MB. has *śatadāyu-mukhyam*.⌋
