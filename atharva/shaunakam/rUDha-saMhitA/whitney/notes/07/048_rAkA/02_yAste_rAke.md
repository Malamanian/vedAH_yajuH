## Translation
2. The well-adorned favors that are thine, O Rākā, wherewith thou givest  
good things to thy worshiper,—with them do thou come to us today  
favoring, granting, O fortunate one, thousand-fold prosperity.

## Notes
The other texts agree throughout and differ from ours only by reading in  
**d** *sahasrapoṣám*, which is given also by the comm., and by three of  
SPP's (ten) authorities. The meter is mixed *triṣṭubh* and *jagatī*.
