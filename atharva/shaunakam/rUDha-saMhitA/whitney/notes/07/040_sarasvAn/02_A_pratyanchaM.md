## Translation
2. We, putting on abundance of wealth \[and\] ambition (?), would ⌊here⌋  
call hither to \[us\] Sarasvant, a bestower coming to meet his bestower  
(*dāśvā́ṅs*), lord of prosperity, standing in wealth, seat of wealths.

## Notes
The translation implies substitution of the Ppp. reading, *śravasyam*,  
for *-syúm* in **c**: the construction is hard enough, even with that  
change. Ppp. also has *rayīṇām* for *rayiṣṭhām* in **b**, and *vasānam*  
(which seems better) at end of **c**. SPP. reads in **a** the impossible  
form *dāśváṅsam* (the comm. has -*vāṅs*-), alleging for it the support  
of most of his authorities; if any of ours have it, the fact was  
overlooked. ⌊Bp.¹ has *dāśvàṅsam;* Bp.² *dāśvàṅssam!*⌋
