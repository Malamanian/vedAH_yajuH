## Translation
2. These hundred veins that are thine, and the thousand tubes—of them  
all of thine I have covered the opening with a stone.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *sākam* for *aham* in **c**. The comm. regards the verse as  
addressed to a *vidveṣiṇī strī*. To him the *hirās* are the minute, and  
the *dhamanīs* the large vessels.
