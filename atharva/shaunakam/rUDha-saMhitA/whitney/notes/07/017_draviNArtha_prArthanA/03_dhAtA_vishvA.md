## Translation
3. Let Dhātar assign all desirable things unto the progeny-wishing  
worshiper in his home; for him let the gods wrap up immortality  
(*amṛ́ta*)—all the gods, Aditi, in unison.

## Notes
This verse occurs only in TS. (iii. 3. 11³) and MS. (iv. 12. 6), both  
reading alike: for **a**, *dhatā́ dadātu dāśúṣe vásūni; mīḍhúṣe* (for  
*dāśúṣe*) in **b**; *amṛ́tāḥ sáṁ vyayantām* in **c**; and *devā́sas* in  
**d**. Ppp. gives, for **a**, *dhātā, viśvāni* ⌊which rectifies the  
meter⌋ *dāśuṣe dadātu;* for **c**, *tasyā prajām amṛtas saṁvayantu;*  
and, in **d**, *devāsas* (rectifying the meter) ⌊and confirming my  
conjecture made at the former occurrence of this pāda at iii. 22. 1  
**d**⌋.
