## Translation
1. Since thou, O off-wiper (*apāmārgá*), hast grown with reverted fruit,  
mayest thou repel (*yu*) from me all curses very far from here.

## Notes
⌊The verse closely resembles iv. 19. 7.⌋ All the authorities (except one  
of SPP's) read *apāmārga* without accent at beginning of **b**; both  
texts make the necessary correction to *áp-*. The comm. understands the  
plant (*Achyranthes aspera:* see note to iv. 17. 6) to be used here as  
fuel.
