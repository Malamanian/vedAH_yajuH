## Translation
2. What \[is\] ill-done, what pollution, or what we have practised  
evilly—by thee, O all-ways-facing off-wiper, we wipe that off  
(*apa-mṛj*).

## Notes
Or (**b**) 'if we have gone about evilly.' All the authorities have  
*táyā* instead of *tváyā* at beginning of **c**, but both texts make the  
obviously necessary correction. The comm. reads *tvayā*.
