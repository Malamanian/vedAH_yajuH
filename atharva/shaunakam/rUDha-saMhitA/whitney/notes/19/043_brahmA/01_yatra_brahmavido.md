## Translation
1. Whither the *brahman*-knowers go, along with consecration, with  
ardor—thither let Agni conduct me; let Agni impart (*dhā*) to me wisdom:  
to Agni hail!

## Notes
SPP. strangely prefers to read *medhā́ da-* in **d**, with a mere  
majority of his authorities, but with the comm. ⌊who gives *medhās*⌋;  
our mss. also are divided between *-dhā́* and *-dhā́ṁ*. In the  
*pada*-text, SPP. emends to *-dhā́ḥ;* the *pada*-mss. have *-dhā́* or  
*-dhā́m*.
