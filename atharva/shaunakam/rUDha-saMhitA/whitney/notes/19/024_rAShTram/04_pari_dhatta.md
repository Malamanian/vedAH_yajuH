## Translation
4. Wrap, set ye him for us with splendor; make him one to die of old  
age; \[make\] long life-time; Bṛihaspati furnished (*pra-yam*) this  
garment to king Soma for wrapping himself.

## Notes
This is a repetition of ii. 13. 2, above. The comm. mentions that the  
verse has been already explained where it first occurred, but adds: "the  
sense, however, is compendiously this," and proceeds to give the same  
exposition over again, word for word (unless, indeed, the editor is  
responsible for the repetition). For the parallel passages etc., see the  
note to ii. 13. 2.
