## Translation
8. Of golden color, unaging, of excellent heroes, having old age as  
death, do thou enter into union (*sam-viś*) with progeny: this Agni  
says, and this Soma says, this Bṛihaspati, Savitar, Indra.

## Notes
The second half-verse we had above as viii. 5. 5 **a, b** ⌊which see;  
and pāda **c** occurred at xvi. 9. 2⌋; the comm. does not notice the  
repetition. He explains *saṁ viśa* as used in the sense of *nirviśa*  
'enjoy'; or else, he says, of *praviśa* = *svagṛham adhitiṣṭha*. Ppp.  
reads in **a** *ajayas suv-*.
