## Translation
2. The gold, of beauteous color by the sun, that men (*mánu*) of old  
with their progeny sought—that, shining (*candrá*), shall unite thee  
with splendor; of long life becomes he who wears it.

## Notes
Very nearly all the mss. read *iṣiré* at end of **b**; but both  
editions, and the comm., give *īṣiré*. The majority of mss. also accent  
*pūrvé*. SPP. reads at end of **c** *sṛjati*, with all the authorities  
(save his P., which has *sṛjāti*)\*; both sense and meter so plainly  
call for *sṛjāti* that we adopted it as an emendation in our text; the  
comm. reads *sṛjatu*. As to *bibharti* at the end, see note to vs. i.  
\*⌊W's P.M. have *sṛjasvā ”yu-*.⌋
