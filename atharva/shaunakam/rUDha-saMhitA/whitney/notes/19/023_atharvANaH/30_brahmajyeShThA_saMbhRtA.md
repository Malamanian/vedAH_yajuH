title = "३० ब्रह्मज्येष्ठा संभृता"

## Translation
30. Heroisms were gathered with the *bráhman* as chief; the *bráhman* as  
chief in the beginning stretched the sky; the Brahmán was born as first  
of creatures; therefore who is fit to contend with the Brahmán?

## Notes
This is a repetition of 22. 21 above; the commentator's text apparently  
gives it in full, as SPP. notes that (doubtless only by an accident) it  
reads this time in **c** *prathamo ‘tha*.
