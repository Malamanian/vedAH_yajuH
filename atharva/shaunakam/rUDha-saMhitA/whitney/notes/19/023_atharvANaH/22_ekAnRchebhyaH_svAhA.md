## Translation
22. To them of a half-verse, hail!

## Notes
All the mss., and the comm., have here *ekānṛcébhyas* (p. *eka॰anṛc-*),  
and SPP. follows them. Our *ekadvyṛcébhyas* (misprinted *ekadvṛc-*) was  
meant as an emendation, but is hardly successful. What *ekānṛc-* should  
mean does not appear; the translation simply follows the comm., for lack  
of anything better.
