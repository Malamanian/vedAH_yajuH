## Translation
1. What thou hast that brings death in old age, O *darbhá*, that has  
hundred-fold defense, good defense, therewith having made this man  
defended (*varmín*), smite thou my rivals by thy heroisms.

## Notes
The translation implies *jarā́mṛtyu śatávarma suvárma te*, which is the  
text of neither edition, nor of the mss., nor of the comm., but simply  
what makes best sense with least departure from the mss. The mss. all  
give *-tyuḥ śatáṁ vármasu* ⌊W's B. *varmasu*⌋ (p. *várma॰su*) *várma  
te;* the comm. has *jarāmṛtyuśatam marmasu* (explaining *jarasām  
mṛtyūnāṁ ca śataṁ granthiṣu!*). The *te* in **b** had to be omitted in  
translating.
