## Translation
2. A hundred are thy defenses, O *darbhá*, a thousand thy heroisms; as  
such, all the gods have given thee to this man to wear, in order to  
\[attain\] old age.

## Notes
Ppp. has at the end *dadus*. The comm. (with two of SPP's mss.) again  
reads in **a** *marmāṇi*. The decided majority of mss. have *tvám* at  
beginning of **c**; none of ours collated before publication had *tám*,  
which is doubtless the true text, and is read ⌊by W's O. and⌋ by SPP.  
and by the comm.
