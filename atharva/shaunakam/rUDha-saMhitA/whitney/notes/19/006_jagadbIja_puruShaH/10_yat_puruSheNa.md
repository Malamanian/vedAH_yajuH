## Translation
10. When, with Purusha as oblation, the gods extended the sacrifice,  
spring was its sacrificial butter, summer its fuel, autumn its oblation.

## Notes
⌊RV. x. 90. 6; VS. xxxi. 14; TA. iii. 12. 3.⌋ ⌊The first half-verse is  
our vii. 5. 4 **a, b**, where, however, *devā́s* follows *yajñám*.⌋ Of  
the other three texts, the only variant is *vasantò ‘sy-* in VS.
