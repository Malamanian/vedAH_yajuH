## Translation
4. Purusha is just this all, what is and what is to be; also \[is he\]  
lord (*īśvará*) of immortality, which was together with another.

## Notes
⌊RV. X. 90. 2; VS. xxxi. 2; SV. i. 620; TA. iii. 12. 1.⌋ The wholly  
obscure last pāda is doubtless a mere corruption, all the other texts  
reading instead *yád ánnenā ’tiróhati* (which is itself obscure enough).  
In **c**, all of them give *ī́śānas;* and in **b**, RV.TA. ⌊and Ppp. and  
KaṭhaB.⌋ have *bhávyam*, SV. *bhā́vyam*, VS. *bhāvyàm;* this last should  
be the reading of our text also, as all the mss. have it; ⌊rather: all  
of W's and seven of SPP's ten authorities;⌋ SPP. accepts it; the comm.  
has *bhavyam*, and, in **d**, *annena*. Some of the mss. accent  
*ányena;* ⌊that is, they have the spelling of *anyéna* and the accent of  
*ánnena*⌋. ⌊Pāda **b** is nearly = xiii. 1. 54 d.⌋
