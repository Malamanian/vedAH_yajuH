## Translation
3. With design to us, O Brihaspati, with design come thou unto us; then  
assign to us of fortune (*bhága*); then be easy of invocation for us.

## Notes
The comm. has in **c** *dehi*. The definition of the verse as an  
*anuṣṭubh* has apparently dropped out of the Anukr. Ppp. reads in **d**  
*subhagas*.
