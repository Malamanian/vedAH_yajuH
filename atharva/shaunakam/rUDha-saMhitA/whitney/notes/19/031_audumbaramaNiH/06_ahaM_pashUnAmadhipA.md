## Translation
6. Let me be the over-ruler of cattle; let the lord of prosperity  
(*puṣṭá-*) assign to me prosperity; let the amulet of *udumbára* confirm  
to me possessions (*dráviṇa*).

## Notes
SPP. leaves *asāni* in **a** unaccented, though every ms. but one  
(doubtless an accidental exception) accents it, and defensibly, on the  
ground of antithesis.
