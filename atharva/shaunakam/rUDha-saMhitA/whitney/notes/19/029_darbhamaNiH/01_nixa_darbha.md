title = "०१ निक्ष दर्भ"

## Translation
1. Gore, O *darbhá*, my rivals; gore those that fight against me; gore  
all my enemies; gore my haters, O amulet.

## Notes
Half the mss. accent in this verse *nikṣá*. The comm. follows the  
*dhātupāṭha* in interpreting it to mean *cumba* 'kiss'! ⌊He intends  
rather the root *cumb* 'harm,' *hiṅsāyām*, not *cumb, vaktrasaṁyoge.*⌋
