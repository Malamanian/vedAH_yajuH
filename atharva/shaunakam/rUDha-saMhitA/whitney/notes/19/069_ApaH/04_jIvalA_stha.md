title = "०४ जीवला स्थ"

## Translation
4. Lively are ye; may I live; may I live my whole life-time.

## Notes
The comm. adds our hymn 70 as fifth verse to this hymn, and then commits  
the blunder of understanding Indra etc., there spoken of, as addressed  
with "living are ye" etc.; it is, of course, the waters that are meant,  
as the liturgical use plainly shows. In vs. 2 all authorities give *úpa  
jīvā́ stha* (p. *úpa: jīvā́ḥ: stha*); ⌊both editions give *upajīvā́s*⌋. In  
vs. 3 they have *saṁjīvā́s* (though with considerable variety of accent);  
most, too, accent *saṁjīvyā́sam*. The comm. reads *upajīvyās* and  
*saṁjīvyās*, which make the decidedly easier sense, 'fit to be lived on  
and with'; then the following clauses would mean 'may I live on you and  
with you.' Ppp. reads throughout *stu* instead of *stha*.
