## Translation
3. In the sky is thy tuft, O herb; in the earth art thou set  
(*ni-sthā*); with thee, that hast a thousand joints, do we increase  
further our life-time.

## Notes
The translation follows the mss., the comm., SPP., and Ppp., all of  
which read *tū́lam* in **a**. ⌊Cf. ii. 7. 3, which perhaps suggested the  
wrong emendation of the Berlin text.⌋ In **b**, the comm. has  
*viṣṭhitas* ⌊and Ppp. *niṣṭhitā*⌋.
