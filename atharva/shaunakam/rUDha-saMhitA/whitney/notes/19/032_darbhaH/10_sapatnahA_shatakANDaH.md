## Translation
10. Rival-slaying, hundred-jointed, powerful, came into being the first  
of plants; let that *darbhá* here protect us all about; by it may I  
overpower fighters, them that fight \[against me\].

## Notes
In **a-b** the mss. read *sáhasvanāú ’ṣadh-* (p. *-svanā: óṣ-*), but  
SPP. emends, as we had done, to *-vān óṣadh-*, as is read ⌊by one of his  
*pada*-mss., p.m.,⌋ by the comm., and also by Ppp. It is a naturally  
suggested conjecture that at some time *-āno-* as written in the Bengālī  
fashion may have been misread into *-anāu-*, and SPP. puts this forward;  
the lateness and unscholarly character of the *pada*-text to this book  
make the assumption of such an error far from implausible; we are  
surprised only at finding the comm's text antecedent to it. In **d** a  
few of the mss. accent *pṛtanyátas*. The verse is *jagatī* only in its  
second half. ⌊Pāda **c** is identical with 33. 1 **c**.⌋
