## Translation
6. Do thou overpower our hostile plotter, overpower those that fight us;  
overpower all enemies (*durhā́rd*); make for me many friends (*suhā́rd*).

## Notes
Most of the mss. read in **d** *bahúm;* Ppp. and the comm. and two of  
SPP's authorities and one of ours have *bakūn*. Ppp. combines and reads  
in **a, b** *no ‘bhimātihaṁ sakarvā pṛ-*.
