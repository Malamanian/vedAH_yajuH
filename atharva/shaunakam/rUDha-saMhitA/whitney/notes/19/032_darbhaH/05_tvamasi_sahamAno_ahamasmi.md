title = "०५ त्वमसि सहमानोऽहमस्मि"

## Translation
5. Thou art overpowering; I am full of power; may we, both of us,  
becoming full of power, overpower our rivals.

## Notes
The comm. reads in **a** *sahamānā;* Ppp. in **a-b**, *-no aham*. To be  
compared is iii. 18. 5 (RV. x. 145. 5), which ends grammatically with a  
dual, *sahāvahāi*. Our *sahiṣīvahi* ⌊*Skt. Gram.* §907⌋ was an  
emendation, but is given also by Ppp.; the mss., SPP., and the comm.,  
have *-mahi*.
