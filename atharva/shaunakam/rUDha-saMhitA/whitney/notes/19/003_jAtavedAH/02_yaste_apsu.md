## Translation
2. What thy greatness is in the waters, what in the woods, what in the  
herbs, in the cattle, within the waters—all thy bodies (*tanū́*), O Agni,  
grasp together; with them come to us, a giver of property, unfailing.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Two or three of our mss., ⌊and (six) half⌋ of SPP's, read *tanvā̀ḥ* in  
**c**, and some of ours have *bharasva* instead of *rabhasva*, probably  
as an only accidental variation, though *bharasva* would be a very good  
reading. A little emendation would rid us of the otiose repetition of  
*apsú* in the first line. ⌊In **d** we have to pronounce *nāí ‘hi*, with  
double sandhi (as often in Ppp.).⌋
