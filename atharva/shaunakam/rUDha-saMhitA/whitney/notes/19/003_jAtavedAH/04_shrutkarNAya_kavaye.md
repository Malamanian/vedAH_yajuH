## Translation
4. To him of hearing ears, the poet, worthy to be known, I apply for  
gifts (*rātí*) with words, with speeches; whence \[there is\] fear, be  
there no fear for us; pacify (*ava-yaj*), O Agni, the wrath (*héḍas*) of  
the gods.

## Notes
The verse is found also in Āp. xiv. 17. 1, but with very different  
**b**: *namobhir nākam upa yāmi śaṅsan;* with *tat kṛdkī naḥ* at end of  
**c**; and, for **d**, *‘gne devānām ava heḍa iyakṣva:* cf. also Āp. v.  
5. 8, which is far more different. ⌊In **c**, *asty* is a misprint for  
*astv*.⌋
