## Translation
3. With the roaring, unwinking, conquering, invincible, immovable, bold  
one—with Indra thus conquer, thus overpower the fighters, O men, with  
the arrow-armed bull (*vṛ́ṣan*).

## Notes
RV. ⌊vs. 2⌋ begins **b** with *yutkāréṇa*, and all the other texts agree  
with it. The comm. carelessly reads *yodhyena* instead of *ay-*,  
explaining it by *yuddhasaṁsaktena;* he takes *yúdhas* in **d** as  
vocative = *yoddhāras;* with *tát* (twice) in **c** he supplies  
*jetavyam* ⌊and *abhibhavanīyam*⌋.
