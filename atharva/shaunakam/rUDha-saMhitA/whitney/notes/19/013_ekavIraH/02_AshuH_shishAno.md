## Translation
2. Swift, sharp, terrible like a bull, greatly smiting, disturber of men  
(*carṣaṇí*), roaring, unwinking, sole hero, Indra conquered a hundred  
armies together.

## Notes
This verse ⌊RV. vs. 1⌋ agrees throughout with the RV. text; SV. and VS.  
show no variants from RV. through the whole hymn; TS.MS. read here in  
**a** *yudhmás* for *bhīmás*, and MS. has also *kṣóbhanas*. The mss.  
also vary in this last word between *-ṇas* and *-nas;* SPP. adopts  
*-ṇas*, as does our text.
