## Translation
1. Time (*kālá*) drives (*vah*) \[as\] a horse with seven reins,  
thousand-eyed, unaging, possessing much seed; him the inspired poets  
mount; his wheels are all beings (*bhúvana*).

## Notes
The 'wheels' in **d** show that the 'mounting' in **c** is not on the  
back of the horse, but on the chariot drawn by him. Ppp. combines in  
**a** *kālo ‘śvo v-*, and reads in **b** *akṣaras*, and in **c**  
*vipaśyatas*. There is nothing at all noteworthy in the exposition of  
the comm. ⌊In **d**, read *cakrā́ṇi?*⌋
