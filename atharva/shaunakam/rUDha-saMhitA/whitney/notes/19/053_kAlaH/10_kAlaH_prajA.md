## Translation
10. Time generated progeny, time in the beginning Prajāpati; the  
self-existent Kaśyapa from time, fervor from time was born.

## Notes
The comm. identifies *Kaśyapa* with the eighth sun as taught in TA. i.  
7. 1. ⌊Cf. Bloomfield's remarks, at AJP. xvii. 403, on the *kaśyapaḥ  
paśyako bhavati* of TA. i. 8. 8.⌋ Ppp. combines in **b** *kālo ‘gre*.
