## Translation
2. She of whom the further limit is not seen, nor what separates; in her  
everything that stirs goes to rest (*ni-viś*); uninjured may we, O wide  
darksome night, attain thy further limit—may we, O excellent one, attain  
thy further limit.

## Notes
In **a**, SPP. accents *dádṛśe*, without adding any note as to  
ms.-readings; it is perhaps merely an oversight, as all our mss. save  
one have plainly *dadṛśé*, and this is the Atharvan accent (cf. x. 8.  
8), against RV. *dádṛśe*, which is wholly anomalous. Ppp. reads  
*yoyavad*, and, in **b**, *ni miṣate rejati;* its **c** is wholly  
corrupt. The comm. connects *na yoyuvat* with what follows, and explains  
it thus: *na vibhajamānaṁ vibhaktaṁ nā ”sīt kiṁ tu viśvam ekākāram evā  
’bhūt*. The RV. *khila*, in vs. 4, has pāda **e**, twice repeated.
