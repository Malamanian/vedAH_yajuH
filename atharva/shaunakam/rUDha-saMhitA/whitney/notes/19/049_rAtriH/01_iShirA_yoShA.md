## Translation
1. The lively woman, household maiden, night, of god Savitar, of Bhaga,  
all-expanded, of easy invocation, of assembled fortune (? *-śrī́*), hath  
filled heaven-and-earth with greatness.

## Notes
In **a**, the *pada*-mss. read *dámūnā;* SPP. emends to *-náḥ*. In  
**c**, all the mss., with the comm. and SPP., read *aśvakṣabhā́* (p.  
*aśva॰kṣabhā́*), which, as being unintelligible, our edition emends at a  
venture to *viśvávyacās*, and the translation follows the latter, for  
lack of anything better. The comm. gives two explanations: *aśu* (=  
*āśu*) + *akṣa* + *bhā* (= *abhibhavati* or *tiraskaroti*), meaning  
*śīghrapravṛtticakṣurādinirodhikā;* or, alternatively, by analogy with  
vs. 4 **c**, *aśvakṣā* (= *aśvān kṣāyati* or *kṣapayati*) *bhā* (=  
*dīptiḥ*) *yasyāḥ sā:* both as absurd as possible. Ppp. reads  
*aśvakṣarā*. Many of the mss. read *sámbhṛtaḥśrīr*, and the *pada*-mss.  
divide falsely *sám॰bhṛtaśrīḥ* instead of *sámbhṛta॰śrīḥ;* SPP. follows  
them. Ppp. reads *saṁbhṛtaḥśīr ā*.
