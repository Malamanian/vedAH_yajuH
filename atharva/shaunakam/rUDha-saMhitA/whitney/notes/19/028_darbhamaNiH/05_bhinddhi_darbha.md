## Translation
5. Split, O *darbhá*, my rivals; split those that fight against me;  
split all my enemies (*durhā́rd*); split my haters, O amulet.

## Notes
In the following fourteen verses, of this hymn and the one that follows  
it, only the verb in each pāda is changed. In **c**, Ppp. blunderingly  
reads *chindhi*, anticipating the next verse.
