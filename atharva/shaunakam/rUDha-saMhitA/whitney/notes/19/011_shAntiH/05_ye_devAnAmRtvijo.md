## Translation
5. They who are the worshipful priests (*ṛtvíj*) of the gods, to be  
worshiped of man (*mánu*), immortal, right-knowing—let them bestow on us  
today wide passage (*urugāyá*): do ye protect us ever with blessings.

## Notes
RV. reads in **a** *devā́nāṁ yajñíyā yajñíyānām*. The comm. apparently  
takes *-gāya* as from *gā* 'sing,' as he glosses *urugāyám* with  
*prabhūtāṁ kīrtim*, and does not even, as is his wont in such cases,  
give an alternative explanation implying *gā* 'go.'
