## Translation
1. Weal for us be the lords of truth; weal for us the coursers and weal  
be the kine; weal for us the Ṛibhus, well-doers, having good hands; weal  
for us be the Fathers at our invocations.

## Notes
This verse and the following one are found in RV. in inverted order (as  
vss. 12 and 11). The comm. quotes sundry RV. verses illustrating the  
character of the Ṛibhus, and is uncertain whether *háva* at the end  
comes from root *hū* or from *hu*.
