title = "०४ आदित्या रुद्रा"

+++
## Translation
4. Let the Ādityas, the Rudras, the Vasus enjoy this very new worship  
(*bráhman*) as it is performed; let there hear us them of the sky, them  
of the earth, also the kine-born, who are worshipful.

## Notes
The RV. version ⌊vs. 14⌋ reads at end of **a** *juṣanta*. The comm.  
explains *gojātās* as the Maruts, born of Pṛśni.
