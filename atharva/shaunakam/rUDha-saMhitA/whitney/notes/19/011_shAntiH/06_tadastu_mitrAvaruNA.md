## Translation
6. Be it so, O Mitra-and-Varuṇa, so, O Agni: weal \[and\] profit for us  
be this praise (*śastá*); may we reach sounding (*gādhá*) and firm  
standing; homage to the great sky, \[our\] seat.

## Notes
The verse is found, without variant, as RV. v. 47. 7. The comm. takes  
*śastam* in **b** as adjective to *śaṁ yos*, which is perhaps better;  
also it connects *bṛhate* with *sādanāya*, and understands by this the  
earth. Ppp. reads in **c** *gātum* for *gādham*, and in **d**  
*sādhanāya*.
