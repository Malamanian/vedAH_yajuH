title = "०१ युतोऽहमयुतो म"

## Translation
1. Unrepelled (? *áyuta*) am I, unrepelled my soul, unrepelled my sight,  
unrepelled my hearing, unrepelled my breath, unrepelled my expiration,  
unrepelled my out-breathing, unrepelled the whole of me.

## Notes
We unfortunately lack the comm's interpretation of *áyuta*, there being  
a lacuna in the ms. at this point; SPP. supplies *sampūrṇa*, it does not  
appear on what authority, but certainly without the least particle of  
plausibility. ⌊The count of the Anukr. (48 syllables) implies  
restoration of all the elided *a*'s.⌋
