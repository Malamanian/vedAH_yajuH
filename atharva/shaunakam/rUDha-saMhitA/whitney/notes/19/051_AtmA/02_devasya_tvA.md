title = "०२ देवस्य त्वा"

## Translation
2. In the impulse of the heavenly impeller (*savitṛ́*), with the arms of  
the Aśvins, with the hands of Pūshan, I, impelled, take hold of thee.

## Notes
To render (in the first clause) 'of god Savitar' would hide the  
word-play between *prasava* and *savitṛ*. The syllables (if the *a* of  
*aśvinos* is restored) count 10 + 11 + 6 = 27: a pretty poor *uṣṇih*.
