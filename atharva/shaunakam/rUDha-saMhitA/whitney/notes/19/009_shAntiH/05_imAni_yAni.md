title = "०५ इमानि यानि"

## Translation
5. These five senses, with mind as sixth, that are in my heart,  
sharpened by *bráhman*, by which is produced what is terrible—by them be  
there appeasement for us.

## Notes
The mss. read *mána ṣaṣṭhā́ni* (p. *mánaḥ: ṣaṣṭhā́ni*), but SPP., as well  
as our text, emends to *-ṭhāni*, and this the comm. also understands. In  
all the verses 3-5, some of the mss. leave *sasṛje* unaccented. This  
verse (10 + 8 + 7: 8 + 8 = 41) is ill defined by the Anukr.
