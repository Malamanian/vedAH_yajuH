## Translation
6. Weal for us be Mitra, weal Varuṇa, weal Vishṇu, weal Prajāpati, weal  
for us Indra, Bṛihaspati, weal for us be Aryaman.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
This verse corresponds nearly to RV. i. 90. 9 and VS. xxxvi. 9; both  
these, however, put the pādas in the order **a, d, c, b**, and they read  
for our **b** *śáṁ no víṣṇur urukramáḥ*.
