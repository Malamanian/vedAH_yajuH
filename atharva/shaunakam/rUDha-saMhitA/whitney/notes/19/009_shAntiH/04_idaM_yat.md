## Translation
4. Or (?) this mind that is most exalted, sharpened by *bráhman*, by  
which is produced what is terrible—by that be there appeasement for us.

## Notes
All the mss. read in **b** *vām* instead of *vā*, and SPP's text follows  
them. The comm. makes no mention of either in its exposition of the  
verse; but its text (so SPP. reports) reads *vā*, as does ours by  
emendation.
