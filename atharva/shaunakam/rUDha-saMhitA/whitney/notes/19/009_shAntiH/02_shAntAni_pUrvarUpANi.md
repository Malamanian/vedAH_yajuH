## Translation
2. Appeased be the foretokens, appeased for us be the-done-and-undone,  
appeased both what is and what is to be: be just everything weal for us.

## Notes
The comm. explains *pūrvarūpāṇi* first as *kāryāpekṣayā  
kāraṇāvasthāpannāni vastūni*, and again as "former births, the fruit of  
evil deeds." Instead of *nas* in **b** it reads *me;* and it points out  
that 'the done' means what is done that should not be done, and 'the  
undone' what was left undone that should have been done—which is far  
from necessary or certain.
