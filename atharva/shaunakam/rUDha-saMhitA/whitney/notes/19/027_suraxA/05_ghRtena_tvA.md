## Translation
5. With ghee do I sprinkle thee all over, O Agni, increasing thee with  
sacrificial butter; of fire, of moon, of sun, let not the wily ones  
damage the breath.

## Notes
The comm. takes the liberty of filling out **c, d** so as to mean "by  
the favor of the fire etc....thy breath, O man that wearest the  
threefold amulet." Some of SPP's mss. read in **a** *ukhyāmi* and  
*ukṣyāmi*.
