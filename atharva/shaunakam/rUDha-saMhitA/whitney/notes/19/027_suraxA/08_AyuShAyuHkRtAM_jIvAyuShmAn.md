## Translation
8. Live thou with the life-time of the life-time-makers; live as one  
long-lived; do not die; live with the breath of the soulful  
(*ātmanvánt*); do not come under the control of death.

## Notes
Nearly all the mss. read in **a** *āyuḥkṛ́tām*, and SPP. follows them,  
although the comm. gives *-uṣk-*. In **c** both the editions emend to  
*ātmanvátām*, all the mss. having *ātmatvátām* (p. *ātma॰tvátām!*); the  
comm. appears to imply *-nvatām* in his explanation, though (according  
to SPP.) his text also has *-tvatām*. Nearly all ⌊SPP's authorities⌋  
accent after it *jīvá;* both editions read *jīva*, ⌊SPP.⌋ on very  
slender authority. Our *úpa gās* in **d** is an emendation, for the *úd  
agās* of the mss., SPP., and the comm.; the change was demanded by the  
requirements both of grammar and of the sense; and Ppp. supports it,  
reading *upa gā v-*.
