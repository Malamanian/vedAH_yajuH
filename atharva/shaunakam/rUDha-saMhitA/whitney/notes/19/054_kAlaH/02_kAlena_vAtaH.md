## Translation
2. ⌊Comm's 2 **a, b, c**.⌋ By time the wind cleanses (*pavate*); by time  
the earth \[is\] great; the great sky in time \[is\] set.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
A part of the verse is lost in Ppp. The comm. adds the first two pādas  
of our vs. 3 to this one, and makes then the three remaining verses of  
four pādas each. This makes a decidedly better division, so far as the  
sense is concerned; but the mss., the Anukr., and SPP. agree in the  
division given in our text (except as regards vs. 6), and it is  
accordingly retained here.
