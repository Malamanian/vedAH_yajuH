title = "०१ अग्निर्मा पातु"

## Translation
1. Let Agni with the Vasus protect me on the east: in him I step, in him  
I take refuge (*śri*), to that stronghold I go forward; let him defend  
me, let him guard me; to him I commit myself: hail!

## Notes
The comm. first understands and explains *krame* and *śraye* as nouns in  
the locative, qualified by *tasmin!* then he again makes them verbs,  
quoting from vs. 6 *tāsu krame tāsu śraye*, to support this  
understanding of them; no one less superficial and blundering could  
possibly suggest the former explanation, against the accent and the  
sense.
