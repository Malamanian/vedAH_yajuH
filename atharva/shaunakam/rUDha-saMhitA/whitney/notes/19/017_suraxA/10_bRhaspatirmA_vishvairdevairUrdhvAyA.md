## Translation
10. Let Bṛihaspati with all the gods protect me from the upward quarter:  
in him I etc. etc.

## Notes
The comm. calls these prose "verses" and those of the next hymn  
*paryāyas;* and the metrical definitions of the Anukr. are of course  
worthless, although it is possible to read out something like the  
numbers of syllables required by that treatise.
