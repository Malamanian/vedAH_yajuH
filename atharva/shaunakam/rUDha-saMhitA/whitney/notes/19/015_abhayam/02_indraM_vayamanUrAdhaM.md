## Translation
2. Indra the success-giver do we invoke; may we be successful with  
biped, with quadruped; let not the niggardly armies come upon us; make  
the haters (*drúh*) disperse and disappear.

## Notes
The translation is defective in making no account of the prefix *anu*  
(twice), which ought to have an appreciable value, although it is very  
difficult to see what; the comm. paraphrases *anurādham* by *anukrameṇa  
pūjanīyam*, and he quotes RV. iv. 25. 8 in illustration of how various  
classes in succession invoke Indra. Ppp. preserves the *a* of *anu* in  
**b**. SPP. reads in **d**, with all the mss., *druhás;* there was no  
good reason for its alteration in our text to *drúhas.*
