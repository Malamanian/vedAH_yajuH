## Translation
5. May the atmosphere make for us fearlessness; fearlessness both  
heaven-and-earth here; fearlessness from behind, fearlessness from in  
front; from above, from below be there fearlessness for us.

## Notes
The comm. prefers to take the words of direction in **c, d** in their  
other admissible sense of points of compass, pointing out that *adhara*  
gets the value 'south' by antithesis to *uttara* 'north.' The verse (11  
+ 12: 11 + 11 \[?\] = 45) is no sort of a *jagatī*.
