## Translation
2. What \[defenses\] he who is lord of creation, Prajāpati, Mātariśvan,  
made for his creatures (*prajā́*), what ones the directions and the  
quarters put on (*vas*)—let those defenses (*várman*) be abundant  
(*bahulá*) for me.

## Notes
The mss. accent *vasaté* ⌊except several that have *vasate*⌋; our  
emendation to *vasáte* is unquestionably called for, even though there  
are a few cases in RV. of such accent as *vasaté* ⌊*Gram.* § 613⌋. The  
comm. etymologizes *mātariśvan* as *antarikṣe śvasitī* '*ti*. ⌊The  
verse is properly 12 + 11: 11 + 11: for **d** has *triṣṭubh* cadence,  
and there are three possibilities of excising a syllable from its prior  
half.⌋
