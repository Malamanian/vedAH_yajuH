## Translation
7. That thou mayest be superior, free from rivals, rival-slaying—mayest  
be controler of thy fellows—so may Savitar make thee: let the unsubdued  
one defend thee.

## Notes
The mss., and SPP., read in **a** *uttarás* (p. *ut॰taráḥ*); our text  
makes the necessary emendation to *úttaras*. In **c**, the same read  
*asat;* we emended to *asas*, and ought to have gone a step further and  
accented *ásas*, since the following *táthā* shows that the three  
preceding pādas are all alike under the government of *yáthā;* Ppp. has  
in **c**, with us, *asas*. Ppp. further combines *‘so ‘sapatnaḥ* in  
**a-b**, and reads *tvā abhi* in **e**.
