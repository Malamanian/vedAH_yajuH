## Translation
2. Weal to thee \[be\] the waters of the wastes, weal be to thee those  
of the marshes; weal to thee the waters of the canals (*khanitríma*),  
weal those brought with vessels.

## Notes
Ppp. has again *śaṁ tā ”po dh-*; ⌊also *-trimā ”paś ś-*⌋. TA. (in vi. 4.  
1) has a verse and a half similar to these two, and in part accordant  
with them (reading corruptly *anū́kyās*): ⌊Poona ed., p. 420, rightly  
*anūkyā̀s*⌋. Our i. 6. 4 above is still more closely analogous.
