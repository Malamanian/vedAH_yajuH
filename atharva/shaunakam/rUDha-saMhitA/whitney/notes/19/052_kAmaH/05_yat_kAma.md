## Translation
5. Desiring what, O desire, we make to thee this oblation, let that all  
succeed with us; then eat (*vī*) thou of this oblation: hail!

## Notes
The verse is found, ⌊cited by *pratīka* at Kāuś. 92. 30, and⌋ written in  
full ⌊*sakalapāṭha*⌋ at 92. 31, prescribed for use at the end of the  
*madhuparka* ceremony.\* SPP. gives the same text as we; the mss. leave  
*kṛṇmási* unaccented in **b**, and most of them accent *té* after it. At  
the beginning, all the *pada*-mss. ⌊except possibly L., of which no note  
is made⌋ very strangely read *yát॰kāmaḥ*, though no *saṁhitā*-mss. have  
*kāmaḥ;* ⌊with the support of the latter, as also of the comm. and of  
Ppp., both ed's read *yát kāma*⌋. \*⌊See p. 897, ¶3.⌋
