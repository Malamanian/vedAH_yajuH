## Comment
⌊Prose.⌋ ⌊Not found in Pāipp.⌋ See note to the preceding hymn ⌊for ritual uses⌋. The gods etc. are throughout the same as in that hymn. ⌊The two hymns are closely accordant in general and special peculiarities of structure.⌋ ⌊A similar passage is found at MS. i. 5. 4, p. 719-15, as W. notes in the Collation Book: he also says "cf. K. vii. 2." AV. v. 10 presents some analogies with our hymn, and iv. 40 still more.⌋
