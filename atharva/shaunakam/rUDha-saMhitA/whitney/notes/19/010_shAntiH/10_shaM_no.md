## Translation
10. Weal for us be the rescuing god Savitar; weal for us be the  
outshining dawns; weal for us be Parjanya for our progeny; weal for us  
be the wealful lord of the field (*kṣétra*).

## Notes
The comm. quotes a verse to the effect that some regard Rudra, and some  
Agni, as 'lord of the field.'
