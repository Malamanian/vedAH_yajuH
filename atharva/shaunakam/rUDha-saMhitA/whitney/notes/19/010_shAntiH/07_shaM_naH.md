## Translation
7. Weal for us be soma, weal for us the *bráhman;* weal for us the  
pressing-stones, and weal be the sacrifices; weal for us be the settings  
of the sacrificial posts; weal for us the sprouts (*prasū́*), and weal be  
the sacrificial hearth (*védi*).

## Notes
The sprouts, namely, of sacrificial grass. The comm. declares *svaru*  
used in the sense of *yūpa* as the thing possessed for the possessor.
