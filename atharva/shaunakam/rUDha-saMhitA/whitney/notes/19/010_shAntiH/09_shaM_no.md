## Translation
9. Weal for us be Aditi with her courses (*vratá*); weal for us be the  
tuneful (*svarká*) Maruts; weal for us Vishṇu, and weal be for us  
Pūshan; weal for us the place of being (? *bhavítra*), and weal be Vāyu.

## Notes
The comm. glosses *vratebhis* with *karmabhiḥ sārdham*, and *bhavitram*  
by *bhuvanam udakam antarikṣaṁ vā*. ⌊Ppp. also reads *bhavitram*.⌋
