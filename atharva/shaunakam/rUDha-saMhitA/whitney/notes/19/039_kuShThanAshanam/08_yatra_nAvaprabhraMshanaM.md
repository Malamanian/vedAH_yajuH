## Translation
8. Where there is no falling downward (?), where the head of the snowy  
\[mountain\], there is the sight of immortality; thence was born the  
*kúṣṭha:*—this all-healing *kúṣṭha* etc. etc. (as vs. 5).

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The mss. all ⌊save SPP's D., which has *nā́vaḥ:* cf. the *navaṣ* of Ppp.⌋  
read in **a** *nā́ ’va prabhráṅśanam* (p. *ná: áva: pra॰bhr-*), and the  
comm. so understands it (*yatra dyuloke tatrasthānāṁ sukṛtinām  
avān̄mukhaprabhraṅśo nā ’sti*); and considering this (if there were such  
a place-name, it is just the sort of thing that we might fairly expect  
the comm. to know and report), and that *nāva* nowhere appears as  
combination-form of *nāu*, and that *pra-bhraṅś* is not used of the  
sliding down of a boat or ship on a mountain, and appears wholly  
unadapted to that use, it must be pronounced an excessively daring and  
not less questionable proceeding to emend to *nāvaprabhráṅśanam*,  
translate it by the "descent of the ship," and connect it with the more  
modern Brāhmaṇa-legend of Manu's flood—as is done in our text, by Weber  
in his notes to *Die Fluthsage* (*Ind. Streifen* i. 11), and by others  
elsewhere ⌊cf. Griffith's note⌋. Ppp. reads ⌊*sa*⌋ *yatra navaṣ  
paribhraśanaṁ*.
