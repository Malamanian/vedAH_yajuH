title = "०३ जीवला नाम"

## Translation
3. "Lively" by name is thy mother; "living" by name is thy father:—by no  
means may etc. etc.

## Notes
All the mss., the comm., and Ppp., read in **b** *jīvantás*, and so of  
course SPP.; there was doubtless no sufficient reason for altering to  
*jīvalás* in our text. Ppp. adds further, after *pitā*, *mārṣa nāma te  
svasā*. With **a, b** compare i. 24. 3 **a, b**.
