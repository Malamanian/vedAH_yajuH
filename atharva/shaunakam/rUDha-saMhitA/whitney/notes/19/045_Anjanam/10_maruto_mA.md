title = "१० मरुतो मा"

## Translation
10. Let the Maruts favor me with troops, in order to breath etc. etc.

## Notes
Ppp. reads this time *suprabhūtaye*. It is possible to make out of these  
prose "verses" the number of syllables demanded by the Anukr. Perhaps  
the modification *nicṛt* belongs only to vss. 7-9 (the manuscripts are  
discordant and unclear).  
  
⌊Here ends the fifth *anuvāka*, with 12 hymns and 74 verses.⌋
