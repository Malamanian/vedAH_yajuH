## Translation
1. Of thousand-fold worth, hundred-jointed, rich in milk, fire of the  
waters, consecration (*rājasū́ya*) of plants—let this *darbhá* here  
protect us all about; may the divine amulet unite us with \[prolonged\]  
life-time.

## Notes
SPP. accents in **a** *sahasrārghás*, with the minority of mss.; Ppp.  
has *-ghyas*. The comm. reads *sahasvān* (for *pay-*), and renders  
*sahasrārghas* by *bahumūlyas*. Ppp. reads in **d** *dāivas* and  
*sṛjātu*.\* The verse is a *jagatī* only in the second half. ⌊Pāda **c**  
is identical with 32. 10 **c**.⌋ \*⌊Other forms like *sṛjātu* under 7.  
4.⌋
