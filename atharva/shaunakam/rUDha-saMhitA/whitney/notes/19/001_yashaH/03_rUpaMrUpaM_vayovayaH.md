## Translation
3. Form by form, vigor (*váyas*) by vigor—taking hold together I  
embrace him: let the four quarters increase this sacrifice; I make  
offering with an oblation of confluence.

## Notes
The comm. understands the sacrificer by *enam* in **b**. ⌊In **c**,  
*cátasraḥ* is metrically and otherwise superfluous.⌋  
  
The metrical definitions given by the Anukr. for this hymn are of no  
value; the first two are inexact even as regards a mechanical count of  
syllables.
