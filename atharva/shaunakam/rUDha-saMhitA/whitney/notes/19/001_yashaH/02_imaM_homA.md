title = "०२ इमं होमा"

## Translation
2. This sacrifice do ye aid, O offerings (*hóma*); this one, ye also  
that flow together: increase ye this sacrifice, O songs; I make offering  
with an oblation of confluence.

## Notes
SPP. reads in **a** *hómās*, with all the mss., but our emendation to  
*homās* is evidently demanded by the sense; the comm. also understands  
the word as vocative. Ppp. reads *homā yajña pacate idaṁ*, and uses the  
last half of vs. 3 as refrain, instead of that of vs. 1.
