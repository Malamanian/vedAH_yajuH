## Translation
1. Together, together let the rivers flow, together the winds, together  
the birds; increase ye this sacrifice, O songs (*gír*); I make offering  
with an oblation of confluence.

## Notes
The first half-verse is nearly identical with i. 15. 1 **a, b**; the  
third pāda, nearly with i. 15. 2 **c**; the last pāda, with i. 15. 1  
**d**; ii. 26. 3 **d**. The translation implies *giras*, voc., in this  
verse and the next; it is read by the mss. almost without exception, and  
so by SPP's text; also in i. 15. 2. Ppp. reads in **a** *sravanti  
sindhavaḥ*.
