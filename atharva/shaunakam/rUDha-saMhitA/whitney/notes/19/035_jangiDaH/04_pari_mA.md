## Translation
4. Me from the sky, me from the earth, from the atmosphere, me from the  
plants, me from what is, and me from what is to be—from every direction  
let the *jan̄giḍá* protect us about.

## Notes
The majority of mss. accent in **c** *mó ’tá bhavyā́t*. One of the mss.  
of the Anukr. calls the verse a *jagatī;* for this there is no ground,  
but also as little for calling it *nicṛt* as a *triṣṭubh*.
