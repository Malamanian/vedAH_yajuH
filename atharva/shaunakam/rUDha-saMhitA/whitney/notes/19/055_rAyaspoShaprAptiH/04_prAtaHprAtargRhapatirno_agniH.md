## Translation
4. Morning after morning \[is\] Agni our house-lord; evening after  
evening \[is he\] giver of well-willing; be thou giver of good to us of  
every kind; kindling thee, may we thrive (*ṛdh*) a hundred winters.

## Notes
In **d** the mss. read *śatáṁhimās* (p. *śatám॰himāḥ*); the comm. takes  
it as two words, *śataṁ himās*, ⌊ignoring the accent⌋. ⌊With pāda **d**,  
cf. RV. i. 64. 14 **d**.⌋ ⌊Cf. vs. 3.⌋
