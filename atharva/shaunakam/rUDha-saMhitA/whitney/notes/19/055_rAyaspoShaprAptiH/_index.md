title = "55. To Agni."

## Comment
Only the first verse is found in Pāipp. (in xx.). The comm. points out that the hymn is plainly meant to be used in the early morning worship of Agni, but quotes no authority. ⌊As to a seventh verse, see SPP's Critical Notice, vol. i., p. 24, and see under vss. 5 and 7.⌋


## Translations
Translated: Ludwig, p. 363; Griffith, ii. 312.
