## Translation
5. Of the sacrifice the eye, beginning, and face; with voice, with  
hearing, with mind do I make oblation; to this sacrifice, extended by  
the all-working one, let the gods come ⌊*ā-i*⌋, with favoring minds.

## Notes
We had this verse above, as ii. 35. 5 ⌊see note thereon⌋. Our mss. cite  
it by the whole first pāda: *yajñásya cákṣuḥ prábhṛtir múkhaṁ cé ’ty  
ékā*. ⌊The Anukr. does not ignore the *ā́* at the beginning of **d**.⌋
