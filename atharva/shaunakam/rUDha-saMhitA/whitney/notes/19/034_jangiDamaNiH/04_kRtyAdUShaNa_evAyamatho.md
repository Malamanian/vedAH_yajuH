## Translation
4. A spoiler of witchcraft verily is this, likewise a spoiler of  
niggardry; likewise may the powerful *jan̄giḍá* lengthen out our  
life-times.

## Notes
The majority of mss. leave *ayám* in **a** unaccented; and they divide  
pretty evenly between *tāriṣat* and *tārṣat* at the end; ⌊cf. under iv.  
10. 6⌋. Ppp. reads *kṛtyādūṣaṇa vāyam atho ‘rāt-*. With the verse  
compare ii. 4. 6, which is nearly the same.
