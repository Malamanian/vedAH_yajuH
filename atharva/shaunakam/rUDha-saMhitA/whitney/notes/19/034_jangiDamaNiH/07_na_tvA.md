## Translation
7. Not the former herbs surpass thee, not thee the recent; a formidable  
dispeller \[is\] the *jan̄giḍá*, a protector round about, of good omen.

## Notes
Some of SPP's mss. read *návā* at end of **b**. The comm. has *jan̄giḍa*  
in **c**; ⌊in both text and comment of the comm., the *ḍa*-sound is,  
naturally enough, spelled with a *la*. Our *pada*-mss. read in **d**  
*paripā́naḥ*, without division.
