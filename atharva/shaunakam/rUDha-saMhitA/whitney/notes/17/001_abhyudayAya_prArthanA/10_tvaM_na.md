## Translation
10. Do thou, O Indra, with propitious aids, be most wealful to  
us—ascending to the triple heaven of the heaven (*dív*), besung unto  
soma-drinking, having a dear abode (*-dhā́man*) unto well-being.—Thine, O  
Vishnu etc. etc.

## Notes
Ppp. reads in **a** *indro adbhiś* (*ś-*). The comm. gives us our choice  
between *-sthāna* and *-tejas* as meanings of *-dhāman* in **e**. The  
verse has two syllables too many for a regular *dhṛti* (72); ⌊it reads  
properly as 5 × 8 and 34; but pāda **a** may be read as 6⌋.
