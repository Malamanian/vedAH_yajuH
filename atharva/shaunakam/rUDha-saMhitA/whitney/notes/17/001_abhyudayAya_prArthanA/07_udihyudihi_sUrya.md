## Translation
7. Arise, arise, O sun; arise upon me with splendor; both those whom I  
see and those whom I do not—among them make thou favor for me. Thine, O  
Vishṇu etc. etc.

## Notes
We should expect *me* for *mā* in **d**; and the comm., on account of  
*mā*, takes *sumatím* as an adjective (= *śobhanabuddhiyuktam*)—which is  
not grammatically impossible, but against all Vedic usage. Verses 6 and  
7, ⌊if the main stock of each verse be read rhythmically,⌋ are  
undoubtedly to be counted as 66 syllables, two less than a true  
*atyaṣṭi* (68), ⌊but also, on the other hand, two more than a true  
*aṣṭi* (64); but the **a** and the **b** of each can be read as 7 so as  
to make totals of just 64: see above, page 806, ¶ 6, note 3⌋ ⌊Concerning  
the_refrain, see notes to vs. 6.⌋
