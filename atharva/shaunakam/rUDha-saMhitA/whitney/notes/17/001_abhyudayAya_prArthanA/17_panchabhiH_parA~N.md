## Translation
17. With five thou heatest upward (*párān̄*), with one hitherward; thou  
goest driving off the imprecation in good weather (*sudína*).—Thine, O  
Vishṇu etc. etc.

## Notes
The comm. supplies, as is natural, *dīdhiti* or *marīci* 'ray' for the  
missing noun, and explains the five as required in order to illuminate  
so many worlds beyond the sun. But Ppp. reads instead *saptabhiṣ p-*  
'with seven.' ⌊With reference to the rays, Griffith (note to xi. 1. 36)  
cites Mahīdhara as quoted by Eggeling on śB. i. 9. 3¹⁶.⌋ The comm. has  
the bad reading *nādhamānas* for *bādh-*. We have to resolve a *saṁdhi*  
in **a** in order to make 58 syllables in the verse.
