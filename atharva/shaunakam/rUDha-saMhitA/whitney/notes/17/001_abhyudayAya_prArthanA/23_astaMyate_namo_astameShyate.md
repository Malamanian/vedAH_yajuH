title = "२३ अस्तंयते नमोऽस्तमेष्यते"

## Translation
23. To the setting one be obeisance; to the one about to set be  
obeisance; to the one that has set be obeisance; to the wide ruler be  
obeisance; to the self-ruler be obeisance; to the universal ruler be  
obeisance.

## Notes
In Vāit. 11. 13, the verse accompanies worship of the setting sun in the  
*agniṣṭoma* ceremony. The Anukr. restores both the elided initial *a*'s  
in the first half-verse, thus counting 35 syllables.
