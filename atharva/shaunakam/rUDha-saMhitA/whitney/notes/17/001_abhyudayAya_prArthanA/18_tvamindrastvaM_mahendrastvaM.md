## Translation
18. Thou art Indra, thou great Indra, thou the world, thou Prajāpati;  
for thee the sacrifice is extended; to thee the offerers make  
oblation.—Thine, O Vishṇu etc. etc.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *viṣṇus* for *lokas* in **b**, and, in **c** *yajāyate* for  
*vi tāyate*. Our Bp.P.M.W. T.R.p.m. also have *jāyate* for *tāyate*. To  
make the verse only *bhurig aṣṭi* (65 syll.), we have to read the first  
pāda as seven syllables, though it easily makes eight. In Vāit. 3. 3 the  
verse, with vi. 5. 2, is made to accompany a *sāṁnāyya* offering to  
Indra, in the *darśapūrṇamāsa* ceremony. In our edition, the *ṁ* of  
*tváṁ* before *lokás* is lost in printing.
