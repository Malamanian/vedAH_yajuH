## Translation
24. This Āditya hath arisen, together with all ardor (*tápas*), making  
subject to me my rivals; and let me not be subject to my hater.—Thine, O  
Vishṇu etc. etc.

## Notes
We have repeated here once more the refrain of vss. 6-19. The verse is  
wanting in Ppp. Pādas **c, d** are nearly identical with our 6 **c, d**  
above. ⌊The main stock of the vs., without the refrain, corresponds to⌋  
RV. i. 50. 13, which reads *sáhasā* in **b**, and *dviṣántam* (for  
*sapátnān*) in **c**; also *mó* for *mā́ ca* in **d**; ⌊and it is also  
TB. iii. 7. 6²³, quoted above in full under vs. 6, which reads like RV.,  
save that it has *máma* for *máhyam* in **c**, and *dviṣató* for  
*dviṣaté* in **d**.—In the Calcutta ed. of TB., *sáhasā* is misprinted  
*máhasā* in the text, but is given aright in the comm. (p. 504), and  
aright in the Poona ed., p. 1105.⌋
