title = "१५ त्वं तृतं"

## Translation
15. Thou goest about Tṛita (?), thou about the fountain of a thousand  
streams, the heaven-gaining council.—Thine, O Vishṇu etc. etc.

## Notes
All the mss., and hence both editions, read *tṛtám* in **a**; but the  
ms. of the comm. has *tritam*, and we cannot well believe that the  
latter is not the true reading; though the sense of the whole verse is  
extremely obscure. The comm. explains *tritam* mysteriously, as either  
*vistīrṇam antarikṣam* or *meghāir āvṛtam udakam*. *Vidatha*, he says, =  
*yajña*. The verse is capable of being read as 56 syllables. Ppp. puts  
it after our verse 17.
