## Translation
19. In the non-existent is the existent made firm; in the existent is  
being (*bhūtá*) made firm; being is set in what is to be; what is to be  
is made firm in being. Thine, O Vishṇu etc. etc.

## Notes
Ppp. combines *bhavyā ”hitam* ⌊double sandhi after *-e* as at ix. 1. 14⌋  
in **c**, and has *samāhitam* for *pratiṣṭhitam* in **d**. The verse,  
like 6 and 7, lacks two syllables of a full *atyaṣṭi;* ⌊but see note to  
vs. 7 and p. 806, ¶ 6, note 3, above⌋.
