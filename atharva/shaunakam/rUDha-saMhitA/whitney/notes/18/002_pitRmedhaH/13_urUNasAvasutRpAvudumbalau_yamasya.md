## Translation
13. Broad-nosed, feeding on lives (? *asutṛ́p*), copper-colored, Yama's  
two messengers go about after men (*jána*); let them give us back here  
today excellent life (*ásu*), to see the sun.

## Notes
The corresponding verse in RV. (x. 14. 12) differs only by combining in  
**a** *-tṛ́pā ud-* (p. *-tṛ́pāu: ud-*). TA. has the verse in vi. 3. 2: it  
reads in **a** *-pāv ulumbalāú* ⌊which seems to answer phonetically to a  
form beginning *uḍum-* and is glossed by *prabhūtabalayuktāu*, as if  
*ulum-*\* were = *urum-*?⌋; in **b**, instead of *jánāṅ*, it reads  
*‘váśāṅ* ⌊i.e. *aváśān:* glossed by *asvādhīnān prāṇinaḥ* and in **d**,  
for *dātām*, it has *dattāv* ⌊accentless, and glossed by  
*prayacchatām!*⌋. Ppp. has the first half-verse, in book xix., reading  
*udumbarāu* and *caratāu*. \*⌊For the confusion between the sounds of  
*ḍ* and *ḷ* and *d* and *l*, see Kuhn's *Pāli-gram.*, p. 37, and cf.  
below, at 3. 1, *-pāláyantī*, *-pād-*.⌋
