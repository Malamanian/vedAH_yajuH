## Translation
7. Go thou to the sun with thine eye, to the wind with thy soul  
(*ātmán*); go both to heaven and to earth with \[their\] due shares (?  
*dhárman*); or go to the waters, if there it is acceptable (*hitá*) to  
thee; in the herbs stand firm with thy bodies.

## Notes
In the corresponding RV. verse (x. 16. 3) is read in **a** *cákṣur  
gachatu* and *ātmā́;* in **b**, *dyā́m* and *dhármaṇā;* TA. (vi. 1. 4: cf.  
9. 2) has the same, but also inserts *te* in *a* after *sū́ryam*, and  
accents *gácha*, Brāhmaṇa-wise, in **b**—as does also SPP. in his text,  
with a minority of his authorities (and our Op.): there is the same  
reason (but no authority) for *gácha* in **a** also, but none in **c**,  
where, nevertheless, our Op. and R.s.m. have *gácha*. The verse lacks a  
syllable of being a full *jagatī*. ⌊Cf. the note to this vs. in my  
*Reader*, p. 379.⌋
