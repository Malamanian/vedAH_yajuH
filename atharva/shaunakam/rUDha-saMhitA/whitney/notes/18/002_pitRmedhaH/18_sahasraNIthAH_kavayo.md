## Translation
18. Poets (*kaví*) of a thousand lays (*-nīthá*), who guard the sun—to  
the seers rich in fervor, born of fervor, O Yama, do thou go.

## Notes
The verse is RV. x. 154. 5, without variant. The comm. adds this time to  
its explanation of *yama* (cf. under vs. 15) *niyata śakaṭe baddha vā*.
