title = "२१ ह्वयामि ते"

## Translation
21. I call thy mind hither with mind; come unto these houses, enjoying  
\[them\]; unite thyself with the Fathers, with Yama; let pleasant,  
helpful (? *śagmá*) winds blow thee unto \[them\].

## Notes
Excepting K., all our mss. read *imā́m* (or *imā́ṁ*) in **b**; SPP.  
records the reading as given only by two of his *pada*-mss. ⌊Pāda **c**  
is RV. x. 14. 8 **a**.⌋ The comm. glosses *śagmās* with *sukhakarās*.  
The Anukr. does not heed the redundant syllable in **b**.
