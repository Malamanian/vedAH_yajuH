## Translation
45. I have measured the measure, I have gone to heaven (*svàr*); may I  
be long-lived; so that etc. etc.

## Notes
⌊The prior half of the verse appears to be prose.⌋ The Anukr. scans 8 +  
6: 8 + 8 = 30 syllables. This verse (according to the comm., vss. 45-47)  
follows the process of measurement (Kāuś. 85. 17).
