title = "३६ शं तप"

## Translation
36. Burn (*tap*) thou propitiously (*śám*); do not burn overmuch; O  
Agni, do not burn the body; be thy vehemence (*śúṣma*) in the woods; on  
the earth be what is thy violence (*háras*).

## Notes
Two of our mss. (R.s.m.Op.), and one of SPP's reciters, leave *tapas* at  
end of **b** unaccented; and this is, of course, more correct. For the  
application of the verse according to Kāuś., see under 2. 4, with which  
it is closely akin in sense. ⌊The comm. reads *tanvas* in **b**.⌋
