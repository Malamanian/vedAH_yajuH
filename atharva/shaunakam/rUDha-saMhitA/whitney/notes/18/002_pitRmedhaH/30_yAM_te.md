## Translation
30. What milch-cow I set down (*ni-pṛ*) for thee, and what rice-dish for  
thee in milk (*kṣīrá*)—with that mayest thou be the supporter of the  
person (*jána*) who is there (*átra*) without a living.

## Notes
That is, 'without the means of sustaining life.' Our Bp.E. read  
*ajīvanas*, unaccented; the normal accent would be *ajīvanás*. The comm.  
remarks that *ni-pṛ* is used distinctively of a gift for the Fathers  
(*pitrye dāne vartate*).
