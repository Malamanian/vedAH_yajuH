## Translation
12. What two defending dogs thou hast, O Yama, four-eyed, sitting by the  
road, men-watching, with them, O king, do thou surround him; assign to  
him well-being and freedom from disease.

## Notes
The verse is RV. x. 14. 11, which in **b** reads *pathirákṣī  
nṛcákṣasāu*, and for **c** *tābhyām enam pári dehi rājan* (our *dhehi*  
is a corruption), and in **d** inserts *ca* after *svastí*. TA. (in vi.  
3. 1) agrees with RV. except in having *-cákṣasā*, and in placing  
*rājan* and *enam* in **c** as does AV. The comm. makes a compound of  
*yamarakṣitārāu* in **a**; and it declares *pari dhehi* in **c** to =  
*paridehi*.
