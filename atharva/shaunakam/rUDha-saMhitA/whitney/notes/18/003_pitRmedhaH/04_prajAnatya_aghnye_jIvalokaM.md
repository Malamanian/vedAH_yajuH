## Translation
4. Foreknowing, O inviolable one, the world of the living, moving  
together \[with him\] upon the road of the gods—this is thy herdsman  
(*gópati*); enjoy him; make him ascend to the heavenly (*svargá*) world.

## Notes
There is no difficulty in understanding this of the *anustaraṇī* cow,  
with the *sūtras* and commentaries, although we should expect rather  
*pitṛlokám* in **a**, and *joṣaya* in **c**. ⌊By "*sūtras*" I suppose W.  
means *sūtra* 20 of Kāuś. 81 (cited under vs. 3) and *sūtra* 37 of Kāuś.  
80 (cited under this vs.); and by "commentaries," the AV. comm. to vss.  
3-4 (vol. iv., p. 131³) and the comm. to the TA. correspondent in vi.  
12. 1 (Poona ed., p. 449) of our vs. 3.⌋ Besides the use of the verse  
with the one preceding, as explained under the latter, it again (Kāuś.  
80. 37) accompanies the leading of a cow around fuel and fire; and the  
schol. (note to 81. 33) employ it further at the kindling of the pile.  
The verse lacks only one syllable of being a regular *triṣṭubh* (11 +  
11: 10 + 11 = 43).
