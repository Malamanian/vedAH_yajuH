## Translation
53. This bowl, O Agni, do not warp (*vi-hvṛ*); \[it is\] dear to the  
gods and the delectable \[Fathers\]; this bowl here for the gods to  
drink from—in it let the immortal gods revel.

## Notes
The RV. has in the corresponding verse (x. 16. 8) *eṣá* for *ayám* in  
**c**, and at the end *mādayante;* TA. (in vi. 1. 4) reads in **a**  
*jīhvaras*, and, like RV., *eṣá* in **c**. The Kāuś. (81. 9) makes it  
accompany the laying of the *iḍā*-bowl on the head of the corpse on the  
funeral pile, when the deceased's sacrificial implements are disposed  
about him to be burned with him. The irregularity of the verse (12 + 11:  
10 + 11 = 44) is unnoticed by the Anukr.
