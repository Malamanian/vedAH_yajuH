## Translation
14. Go away, ye Fathers, and come; this sacrifice is all anointed with  
honey for you; both give to us here excellent property, and assign to us  
wealth having all heroes.

## Notes
The second half-verse is found also in AśS. (ii. 7. 9) and MB. (ii. 3.  
5); both read at the end *ni yacchata*, and at the beginning MB. has  
*dattā ’sm-*, and AśS. strangely *dattāyā ’sm-*. ⌊Our *pada*-texts read  
*dattó* (=*dattá u*) *íti:* see Prāt. i. 80.⌋ The translation implies  
that *dráviṇe ’há* is for *dráviṇam ihá* (p. *dráviṇā: ihá*); the comm.  
glosses *dráviṇā* by *draviṇam;* ⌊cf. my *Noun-Inflection*, p. 331, ¶  
4⌋. The comm. also understands the first pāda to signify that the  
Fathers are to go to their own world, and then to return when invoked to  
their own sacrifice; and this is probably the sense.
