## Translation
20. Ye who are Atris, An̄girases, Navagvas, having sacrificed, attached  
to giving (? *rātiṣā́c*), bestowers (*dádhāna*), and who are rich in  
sacrificial fees, well-doing—do ye revel, sitting on this *barhís*.

## Notes
The meaning of some of these epithets is not altogether clear. No use is  
made of the verse in the *sūtras*.
