## Translation
12. Mitra-and-Varuṇa have enclosed (*pari-dhā*) me; let the sacrificial  
posts of Aditi increase me; let Indra anoint splendor into my hands; let  
Savitar make me one attaining old age.

## Notes
Most of our mss. (all except Op.R.), and half of SPP's, read at the  
beginning *mítrāvaruṇā* (Bp. *-ṇāu*), vocative, which might stand if we  
altered *adhātām* to *-thām;* both editions give *mitrā́váruṇā*, ours by  
emendation. A variant for *sváravas* in **b** would be very welcome; the  
comm. gets rid of the difficulty in its characteristic way, by making  
the word an adjective to *ādityās*, and signifying either "making a  
pleasant sound" or "making a distress directed at our enemies"! The  
third pāda, if properly read, has a redundant syllable; but the Anukr.  
would apparently have us read *nyanaktu* in three syllables, as written.  
The Kāuś. uses the verse with washing the hands, at the end of the  
cremation ceremony (81. 46), and at the beginning of the  
*piṇḍapitṛyajña* (87. 3); the comm. notices only the latter of the two  
uses.
