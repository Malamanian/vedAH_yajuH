title = "६४ आ रोहत"

## Translation
64. Ascend ye to the highest heaven; O seers, be not afraid; ye  
soma-drinkers, soma-drenchers, this oblation is made to you; we have  
gone to the highest light.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Encouraged by the comm. (*anyān api yajamānān somam pāyayanti*), the  
translation mends the repetition in **c** by violently taking *-pāyin*  
as causative to *-pā*.
