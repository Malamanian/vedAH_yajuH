## Translation
42. Thou, O Agni, Jātavedas, being praised, hast carried the offerings,  
having made them fragrant; thou hast given to the Fathers; they have  
eaten after their wont (? *svadháyā*); eat thou, O god, the presented  
oblations.

## Notes
The verse corresponds to RV. x. 15. 12, found also in VS. (xix. 66) and  
TS. (in ii. 6. 12⁵). ⌊Disregarding *īlitó*,⌋ RV. differs only by reading  
*kṛtvī́* at end of **b**; and VS. agrees with it in this, but has  
*kavyavāhana* for *jātavedas* in **a**; ⌊TS. agrees with AV.  
throughout⌋. Āp. (in i. 10. 14) and MB. (ii. 3. 17) have a verse that  
agrees with this in **b** and **c**, save that MB. has *prā ’dāt* for  
*prā ’dās* in **c**: but their **a** is *abhūn no dūto haviṣo  
jātavedāḥ;* and for **d**, Āp. has *prajānann agne punar apy ehi devān*,  
while MB. reads *p, a. p. ehi yonim*. The second half-verse occurs again  
below as 4. 65 **c, d**. Kāuś. (89. 13) makes the verse, with 4. 88, and  
with two verses not found elsewhere, accompany the feeding of the fire  
at the end of the *piṇḍapitṛyajña*. ⌊The forms *ávāṭ* and *akṣan* are  
treated, *Gram.* §890 a and §833 a. As for the sandhi *ḍhḍh* of the  
mss., see note to Prāt. i. 94.⌋
