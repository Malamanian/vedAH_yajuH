## Translation
14. He that hath sacrificed hath ascended the piled fire, about to fly  
up to heaven (*dív*) from the back of the firmament (*nā́ka*); for him,  
the well-doer, shines forth from the welkin (*nábhas*), full of light,  
the heavenly road, traveled by the gods.

## Notes
The mss. vary in **a** between *citám* and *cittám;* our text reads the  
latter; SPP's the former, which is doubtless correct, and which is  
implied by the translation. The comm. notes that *agni* is used to mean  
*iṣṭakacitaḥ pradeśaḥ*, quoting Āpast. 25. 4 as authority. According to  
Kāuś. (80. 52), the verse (the comm. says, vss. 14-15) accompanies the  
laying of the body supine on the pile; it comes next after 1. 46.
