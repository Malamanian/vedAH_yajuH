## Translation
38. Be thou just here, winning riches, with thought here, with ability  
here; be thou here, very heroic, vigor-bestowing, not smitten away.

## Notes
The comm. understands *iha citta iha kratuḥ* as four independent words.  
According to Kāuś. (87. 21), the verse is made to accompany the taking  
of one of two lighted sticks of wood (see under 1. 56), and setting it  
up in the dirt (see under 2. 34). That this was its original office may  
be questioned; perhaps it is rather an invocation of the ancestor for  
help to his descendants.
