title = "२५ अपूपापिहितान् कुम्भान्"

## Translation
25. What vessels covered with cakes the gods maintained for thee, be  
they for thee rich in *svadhā́*, rich in honey, dripping with ghee.

## Notes
This is a ⌊precise⌋ repetition of 3. 68 above. While most of the mss.  
quote it, as usual, by the first words with *íty ékā* added, two (O.R.)  
write it in full. According to the comm., the verse follows the  
deposition of the nine dishes; and it adds: "one should put on mixed  
grains"; the Kāuś. makes no mention of it.
