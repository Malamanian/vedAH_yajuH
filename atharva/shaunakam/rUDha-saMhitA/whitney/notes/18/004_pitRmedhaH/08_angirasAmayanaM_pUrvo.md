## Translation
8. The track (*áyana*) of the An̄girases is the eastern fire; the  
Ādityas' track is the householder's fire; the track of the sacrificial  
gifts is the southern fire; do thou, with thy limbs, whole (*sárva*),  
powerful (? *śagmá*), go unto the greatness of Agni \[as\] disposed by  
*bráhman*.

## Notes
Both in this verse and in the next, most of our mss. accent falsely  
*dákṣiṇāgnis; SPP*. reports it of only one of his, and only in vs. 9.  
The comm. glosses *śagma* with *sukhita*. The verse (11 + 11 + 11: 13 +  
11 = 57) counts short of what the Anukr. describes it (*atiśakvarī* = 60  
syll.).
