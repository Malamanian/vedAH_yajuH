## Translation
42. What stirabout for thee, what rice-dish, what flesh I offer  
(*ni-pṛ*) to thee, be they for thee rich in *svadhā́*, rich in honey,  
dripping with ghee.

## Notes
The second half-verse is identical with 3. 68 **c, d**, above. Nearly  
all the mss. (of ours, all save Op.) accent *mántham* in **a**; both  
editions read *manthám*. The comm. again ⌊see under 2. 30⌋ notes the  
technical sense of *ni-pṛ: niparaṇaṁ nāma pitryopavītinā parācīnapāṇinā  
pitrarthaṁ coditadravyasya prakṣepaḥ*. By Kāuś. 84. 6, the verse  
accompanies an offering of the articles mentioned, in the hut (*vimita*)  
in the preparation for interment of the relics; the comm. overlooks  
this. ⌊For the ceremony, cf. Caland, *Todtengebräuche*, p. 137.⌋
