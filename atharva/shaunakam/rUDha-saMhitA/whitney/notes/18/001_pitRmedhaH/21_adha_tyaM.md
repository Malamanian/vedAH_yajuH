## Translation
21. Then that mighty (*vibhū́*) conspicuous drop did the bird, the lively  
falcon, bring at the sacrifice; if the Aryan tribes (*víś*) choose the  
wondrous one, Agni, \[as\] *hótṛ*, then prayer (*dhī́*) was born.

## Notes
RV. x. 11. 4 differs only by reading *iṣitás* in **b**. The comm. makes  
a couple of references, to TB. iii. 2. 1¹ and TS. vi. 1. 6¹, where the  
legends of the bringing of soma from heaven by the falcon are given.  
Prāt. iii. 25 notes the short final of *ádha* in **a** and **d**.
