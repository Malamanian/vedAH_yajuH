## Translation
3. Truly those immortals want that—posterity (? *tyajás*) of the one  
mortal; may thy mind be set in our mind; mayest thou enter \[as\]  
husband a wife's body.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The verse shows no variant from RV. x. 10. 3. Bs.E. read in **d**  
*tanvā̀m*. The comm. explains *tyajásam* by *tyāgam, garbhān nirgamanam,  
utpattim*. ⌊Cf. Weber, *Sb.*, p. 824.⌋
