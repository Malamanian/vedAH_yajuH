## Translation
7. Who knows of that first day? who saw it? who shall proclaim it here?  
Great is the ordinance (*dhā́man*) of Mitra, of Varuṇa; why, O lustful  
one, wilt thou speak to men with deceit (? *vī́ci*)?

## Notes
RV. x. 10. 6 has no variants. The comm. blunderingly attributes the  
verse to Yamī; he also takes *vī́cyā* ⌊p. *vī́cyā*⌋ as for *vī́cyās*, an  
adj. meaning *vividham añcanto gacchantaḥ saṁcarantaḥ*, and qualifying  
*nṛ́n*, which is used as nominative, = *narās!* ⌊See Geldner,  
*Gurupūjākaumudī*, p. 21-22.⌋
