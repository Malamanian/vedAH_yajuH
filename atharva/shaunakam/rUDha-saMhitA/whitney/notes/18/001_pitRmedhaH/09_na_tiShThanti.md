title = "०९ न तिष्ठन्ति"

## Translation
9. They stand not, they wink not, those spies of the gods who go about  
here; with another than me, O lustful one, go quickly; with him whirl  
off like two chariot wheels.

## Notes
The verse is RV. x. 10. 8, without variant. The comm. reads *eke* at end  
of **a**; he explains *tū́yam* in **c** by *tūrṇam*, and supplies  
*ramasva:* 'hasten to enjoy thyself.'
