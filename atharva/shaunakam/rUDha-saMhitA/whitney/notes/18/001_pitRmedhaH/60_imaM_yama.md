## Translation
60. Ascend thou, O Yama, this cushion (*prastará*), in concord with the  
An̄giras Fathers; let the sacred utterances (*mántra*) made in praise by  
the poets bring thee; then (*enā́*), O king, revel thou in the oblation.

## Notes
This verse also is found as RV. x. 14. 4, and in TS. ii. 6. 12⁶ and MS.  
iv. 14. 16, all of which have *sī́da* for *róha* in **a**, and *havíṣā*  
for *-ṣas* in **d**. The comm., too, reads *sīda*. The only one of our  
mss. that accents *róha* is Op., and our reading the word with an accent  
was an emendation; SPP. gives the same, on the authority of most of his  
mss. ⌊The comm. calls *hí* an expletive.⌋ Kāuś. 84. 2 uses the verse  
with an offering to Yama in the ceremony of interment of the bones; and  
the comment appears to quote the same rule under 45. 14, in the  
*vaśāśamana* rite.
