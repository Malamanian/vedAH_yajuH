title = "४७ मातली कव्यैर्यमो"

## Translation
47. Mātālī with the *kavyás*, Yama with the An̄girases, Brihaspati  
increasing with the *ṛ́kvans* ('praisers'); both they whom the gods  
increased and who \[increased\] the gods—let those Fathers aid us at our  
calls.

## Notes
RV. x. 14. 3 has the first three pādas, but, instead of repeating our 44  
**d**, reads for the fourth *svā́hā ‘nyé svadháyā ‘nyé madanti;* and TS.  
(ii. 6. 12⁵) and MS. (iv. 14. 16) agree with it in so doing.
