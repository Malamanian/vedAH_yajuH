## Translation
31. I praise (*arc*) your (du.) work unto increase, ye ghee-surfaced  
ones; O heaven-and-earth, hear me, ye two firmaments (*ródasī*); when  
days, O gods, went to the other life (*ásunīti*), let the two parents  
(*pitárā*) sharpen us here with honey.

## Notes
The rendering is only mechanical, the obscurity of the verse being  
unresolved. It is RV. x. 12. 4, which, however, reads for **c** *áhā yád  
dyā́vó ‘sunītim áyan*. Our mss. and the authorities of SPP. vary in **c**  
between *devā́s*, *dévās*, and *devās;* SPP. reads *devā́s*, with ⌊at  
least⌋ two of his; our *dévās* is not defensible; the translation  
implies *devās*. The comm. makes the word the subject of *ā́yan*, taking  
*áhā* (p. *áhā*) as for *ahaḥsu;* he explains *devās* by *stotāras* or  
*ṛtvijas*. Our Bp. is the only *pada*-ms. that reads (with the RV.  
*pada*) *ápaḥ* in **a**; the others have *ā́paḥ;* but, as the comm. gives  
the former, SPP. adopts it in his text. A majority of SPP's mss. accent  
*ghṛtásnū*, but only one of ours (O.) does so.
