## Translation
22. Ever art thou pleasant (*raṇvá*), as pastures to him that enjoys  
(*puṣ*) them, being, O Agni, well sacrificed to with the offerings of  
man (*mánus*); or when, active, praiseworthy, having won the strength  
(*vā́ja*) of the inspired one (*vípra*), thou approachest with very many.

## Notes
RV. x. 11. 5 differs only by reading *ukthyàm* at end of **c**. The  
construction and meaning of the second half-verse are difficult and  
obscure. The comm. explains *śaśamānas* by *śaṅsan yajamānam praśaṅsan*  
(similarly the comm. to RV.); and *bhūribhis* as "accompanied by many  
desires or else by many gods" (RV. comm. only the latter).
