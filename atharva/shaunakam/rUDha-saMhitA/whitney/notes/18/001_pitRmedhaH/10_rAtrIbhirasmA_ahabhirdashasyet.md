## Translation
10. By nights, by days one may pay reverence (*daśasy*) to him; the  
sun's eye may open (? *ún mimīyāt*) for a moment; with heaven, with  
earth paired, of near connection;—Yamī must bear the unbrotherly  
(*ájāmi*) \[conduct\] of Yama.

## Notes
RV. x. 10. 9 differs from our text only by reading in **d** *bibhṛyāt;*  
and this reading the translation implies, *vivṛhāt* seeming  
unexplainable save as a corruption, suggested by the forms of *vi-vṛh*  
in the two preceding verses. The connection of the verse is very loose,  
and the sense of **b** especially doubtful. One is tempted to emend to  
*mimīlyāt;* but *ā́ mimīyāt* is found in TB. iii. 6. 13 ⌊2d *prāiṣa*⌋,  
explained by its commentary as meaning *āgatya praviśeyuḥ*. Our comm.  
explains? *ún m-* as *úrdhvaṁ gacchet* (the RV. comm. as *ud etu*). Our  
comm. further reads at the end *ajāmis*, and understands it of Yamī. The  
adjectives in **c** are dual; the comm. supplies "earth with heaven and  
heaven with earth." ⌊Cf. Weber, *Sb.*, p. 823.⌋
