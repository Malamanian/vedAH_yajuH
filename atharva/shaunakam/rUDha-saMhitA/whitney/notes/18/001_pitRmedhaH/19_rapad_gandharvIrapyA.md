## Translation
19. Prateth the Gandharvī and watery woman; in the noise of the noisy  
one (*nadá*) let \[her\] protect our mind; let Aditi set us in the midst  
of what is desired (? *iṣṭá*); our oldest brother shall first speak out.

## Notes
RV. x. 11. 2 has for sole variant *me* for *nas* in **b**. The comm. to  
the first half-verse appears to be defective; but it certainly  
understands the goddesses Bhāratī and Sarasvatī to be intended in **a**;  
*iṣṭasya* is either *phalasya* or *yāgasya;* the "brother" is Agni.
