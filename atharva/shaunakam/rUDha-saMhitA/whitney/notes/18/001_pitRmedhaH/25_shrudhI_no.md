title = "२५ श्रुधी नो"

## Translation
25. Hear us, O Agni, in thy seat, thy station; harness the speedy  
chariot of the immortal (*amṛ́ta*); bring to us the two firmaments  
(*ródasī*), parents of the gods; be thou of the gods never (*mā́kis*)  
away; mayest thou be here.

## Notes
The verse is RV. x. 11. 9 (and 12. 9), without variant. The comm.  
comfortably supplies *saṁghe* in **d** to govern the genitive *devānām*.  
Then, as alternative explanation, he understands *bhūs* and *syās* as  
third persons, and *mā́kis* as "no one."
