## Translation
29. Heaven and earth, first by right, truth-speaking, are within  
hearing, when the god, making mortals to sacrifice, sits as *hótṛ*,  
going to meet his own being (*ásu*).

## Notes
The verse is RV. x. 12. 1, without variant. Some of our mss. (Bp.Bs.Op.)  
read *abhisrāvé* in **b**. The comm. explains the word by *stotuḥ  
śravaṇayogye*.
