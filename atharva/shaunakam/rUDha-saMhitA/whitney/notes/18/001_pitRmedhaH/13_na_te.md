title = "१३ न ते"

## Translation
13. I am not thy protector here, O Yamī; I may not mingle my body with  
thy body; with another than me do thou prepare enjoyments; thy brother  
wants not that, O fortunate one.

## Notes
All our mss. save Op.K. accent *yámi* in **a**; SPP. reports only one of  
his as doing so. RV. x. 10. 12 is in our text expanded into two verses,  
its second half being our **c, d**, without variant. The comm. reads  
*nūnam* for *tanūm* in **b**; he explains *nāthám* in **a** by  
*abhimatārthasampādakas*.
