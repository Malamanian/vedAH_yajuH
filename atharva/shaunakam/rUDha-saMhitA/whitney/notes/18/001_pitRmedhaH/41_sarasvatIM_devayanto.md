title = "४१ सरस्वतीं देवयन्तो"

## Translation
41. On Sarasvatī do the pious call; on Sarasvatī , while the sacrifice  
is being extended; on Sarasvatī do the well-doers call: may Sarasvatī  
give what is desirable to the worshiper (*dāśvā́ṅs*).

## Notes
RV. x. 17. 7 is the same verse, but makes better meter by having  
*ahvayanta* for *havante* in **c**; and the comm. agrees with it. Verses  
41-43, with others to Sarasvatī (vii. 68. 1-2; also xviii. 3. 25), are  
used by Kāuś. (81. 39) in the *pitṛmedha* ceremony, accompanying  
offerings to Sarasvatī. ⌊And they recur below, as noted under vs. 43.⌋  
The Anukr. takes no notice of the deficiency of a syllable in 41 **c**,  
and 42 **a**, nor of the excess of two syllables in 43 **a**.
