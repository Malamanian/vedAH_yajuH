## Translation
8. Desire of Yama hath come unto me Yamī, in order to lying together in  
the same lair (*yóni*); I would fain yield (*ric*) my body, as wife to  
husband; may we whirl off, like two chariot wheels.

## Notes
That is, probably, like the wheels of two chariots interlocked with each  
other in battle. RV. x. 10. 7 has no variants from our text. The comm.  
makes *ví vṛheva* mean *saṁśleṣaṁ karavāva*, adding *itaretarayoḥ  
saṁśleṣo vivarhā;* and his first explanation of *rathyā* is as =  
*rathyayā* 'on the carriage road'! Our P.M.I. accent *vṛhéva*. The  
metrical definition of the Anukr. as *pan̄kti* is very strange, though  
the verse can be reduced to 40 syllables by refusing to make ordinary  
resolutions.
