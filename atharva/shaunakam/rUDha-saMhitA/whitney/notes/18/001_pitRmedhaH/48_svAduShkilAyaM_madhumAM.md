title = "४८ स्वादुष्किलायं मधुमां"

## Translation
48. Sweet verily is this \[*sóma*\], and full of honey is this; strong  
(*tīvrá*) verily is this, and full of sap is this; and no one soever  
overpowers in conflicts (*āhavá*) Indra, having now drunk of it.

## Notes
The verse is RV. vi. 47. 1, without real variant; its applicability in  
the funeral book is not apparent, and neither Kāuś. nor Vāit. uses it.  
Part of our mss. (O.R.K.), with nearly all SPP's, combine at the  
beginning *svādúṣ k-*, which RV. also has; and SPP., with good reason,  
adopts this in his text.
