title = "५० यमो नो"

## Translation
50. Yama first found for us a track (*gātú*); that is not a pasture to  
be borne away; where our former Fathers went forth, there (*enā́*) \[go\]  
those born \[of them\], along their own roads.

## Notes
The corresponding RV. verse (x. 14. 2) reads *pareyús* at end of **c**,  
and MS. (in iv. 14. 16) agrees with it. The comm. has *yena* instead of  
*enā* in **d**. The verse (with vs. 51?) is used by Kāuś. (81. 35) next  
after the preceding one, in the same ceremony.
