## Translation
4. Daughter of faith, born out of fervor, sister of the being-making  
seers was she; do thou, O girdle, assign to us thought (*matí*), wisdom;  
also assign to us fervor and Indra's power.

## Notes
All the mss. (and both editions) accent *babhū́va* at end of **b**, as if  
a relative were expressed or implied in the line somewhere. The verse is  
really mixed *triṣṭubh* and *jagatī*; ⌊**a** is *jagatī* only by count;  
*no* in **c** looks like an intrusion⌋. ⌊As to the combination *-sa  
ṛṣ-*, see note to Prāt. iii. 46.⌋
