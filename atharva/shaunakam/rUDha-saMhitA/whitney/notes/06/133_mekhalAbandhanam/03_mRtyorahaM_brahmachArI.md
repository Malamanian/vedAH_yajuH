title = "०३ मृत्योरहं ब्रह्मचारी"

## Translation
3. Since I am death's student (*brahmacārín*), soliciting from existence  
(? *bhūtá*) a man (*púruṣa*) for Yama, him do I, by incantation  
(*bráhman*), by fervor, by toil, tie with this girdle.

## Notes
It is the duty of a Vedic student to beg provision for his teacher. Ppp.  
begins **b** with *bhūtāu niryācan*. The comm. reads *niryācam*,  
explaining it as first person sing. (= *yāce*)! The result he takes to  
be "by this binding on of a girdle I impede the progress of my enemy."  
Pāda **c** has a redundant syllable.
