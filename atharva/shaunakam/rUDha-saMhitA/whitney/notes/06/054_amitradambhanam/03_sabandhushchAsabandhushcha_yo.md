## Translation
3. Whoever, both related and unrelated, assails us—every such one  
mayest thou make subject to me, the sacrificer, the soma-presser.

## Notes
The first half-verse is also 15. 2 **a, b**, above; the last half-verse  
is also 6. 1 **c, d**. Ppp. has, for **b**, *yo jāto yaś ca niṣṭyaḥ;* it  
further puts **d** before **c**, in the form *sarvaṁ īvaṁ rīradhāsi  
naḥ*.
