## Translation
2. Pour ye on with the *jālāṣá;* pour in with the *jālāṣá;* the  
*jālāṣá* is a formidable remedy; with it do thou be gracious to us, unto  
life (*jīvás*).

## Notes
Ppp. has, for second half-verse, *jālāṣe bhadraṁ bheṣajaṁ tasyo no dehi  
jīvase*, which is better. The comm. reads *jal-* in all three cases; and  
it has the RV. form *mṛḻa* in **d**; it understands the foam of cows'  
urine to be intended by *jalāṣa* ⌊See Bloomfield, AJP. xii. 425⌋.
