## Translation
1. This verily is a remedy; this is Rudra's remedy; wherewith one may  
spell away (*apa-brū*) the one-shafted (*-téjana*), hundred-tipped  
arrow.

## Notes
The comm. has at the end *upabruvat*. He regards the remedy as used  
against the *vraṇaroga*, and the arrow of **c, d** as that of Mahadeva,  
used *tripurasaṁhṛtisamaye*.
