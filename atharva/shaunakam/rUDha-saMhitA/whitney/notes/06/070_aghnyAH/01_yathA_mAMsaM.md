## Translation
1. As flesh, as strong-drink, as dice on the gambling-board; as of a  
lustful man the mind is fastened (*ni-han*) on a woman—-so let thy mind,  
O inviolable one (*aghnyā́*), be fastened on thy calf.

## Notes
The verses are six-pāda *jagatī* (6 × 8 = 48). ⌊The stanza is wrongly  
numbered.⌋
