## Translation
3. As the felly (*pradhí*), as the rim (*upadhí*), as the nave upon the  
felly; as of a lustful man etc. etc.  
  
⌊See p. xcii.⌋

## Notes
The first line is again obscure, both in its internal relations and in  
its relation to the refrain (in this resembling 1 **a, b**). BR. define  
*upadhi* as 'the part of the wheel between the felly and nave,' but this  
ought to be *arās* 'the spokes': the comm. explains it as 'the circle,  
bound together by the felly, that is the binder together of the spokes'  
(*nemisambaddhaḥ arāṇāṁ sambandhako valayaḥ*)—i.e. a sort of rim inside  
the felly. Probably a solid wheel, without spokes, is had in view. We  
should expect some other preposition than *adhi* 'on' to express the  
relation of the nave to the felly.
