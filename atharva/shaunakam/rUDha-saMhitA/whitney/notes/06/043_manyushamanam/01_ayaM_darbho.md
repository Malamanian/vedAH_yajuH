## Translation
1. This *darbhá* \[is\] fury-removing, both for one's own man and for a  
stranger; and this is called a fury-removing fury-appeaser of fury.

## Notes
The translation implies the emendation of *vimanyukasya* in **c** to  
*-kaś ca* (as proposed by Grill, and virtually by Florenz). Ppp.  
supports the change, reading *vimanyako manyuśamano ‘stu me;* it has  
*vimanyakas* also in **a**.
