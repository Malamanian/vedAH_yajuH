title = "०१ यथा वृक्षं"

## Translation
1. As the creeper (*líbujā*) has completely embraced the tree, so do  
thou embrace me—that thou mayest be one loving me, that thou mayest be  
one not going away from me.

## Notes
The refrain of the hymn is found twice above, at the end of i. 34. 5;  
ii. 30. 1. SPP. here again, in opposition to his mss., gives the  
*pada*-reading *ápa॰gāḥ* in **e**. The Anukr. takes no notice of the  
metrical deficiency of **a** ⌊but see note to 7. 1⌋.
