## Translation
2. Let Aditi shave the beard; let the waters wet \[it\] with splendor;  
let Prajāpati nurse (*cikits*) \[it\], in order to length of life, to  
sight.

## Notes
Ppp's version of **c, d** is *dhārayatu prajāpatiḥ punaḥ-punaḥ  
suvaptave*. AGS. (i. 17. 7) has **a, b**, reading *keśān* for *śmaśru*,  
and *varcase* for *-sā*; PGS. (ii. 1. 6) has *adite keśān vapa*,  
parallel to our **a**.
