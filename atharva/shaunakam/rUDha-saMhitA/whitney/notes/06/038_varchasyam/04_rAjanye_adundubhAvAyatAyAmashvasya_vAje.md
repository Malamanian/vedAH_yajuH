## Translation
4. In a noble (*rājanyà*), in the drum, in the drawn \[arrow\], in the  
horse's vigor, in man's roar (?): the fortunate goddess etc. etc.

## Notes
Ppp. and TB. agree in prefixing *yā́* at the beginning of the verse, and  
TB. has *krándye* for *vā́je* in **b**, while Ppp. has, for **b**,  
*tviṣir aśve māyāṁ stanayitna goṣu yā*. *Māyú* is not properly used of  
*púruṣa* 'man,' and the expression is obscure and doubtful. The comm.  
takes *ā́yatāyām* as = *ātāḍyamānāyām* and qualifying *dundubhāú!* ⌊For  
the meaning here assigned to it, see note to vi. 65. i.⌋ In this hymn,  
again, it appears as if the equivalence to three verses were recognized,  
the refrain of vss. 2, 3 being left out of account. But the Anukr.  
acknowledges four verses, and each of the four has its refrain in TB.
