## Translation
1. What brilliancy (*tvíṣi*) is in lion, in tiger, and what in adder, in  
fire, in the Brāhman, what in the sun: the fortunate goddess that gave  
birth to Indra—let her come to us, in union with splendor.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *vavardha* for *jajāna* in **c**, and *sā ā ni ’tu* in **d**.  
TB. has in the refrain *ā́ ’gan* (or *ā́ gan*) for *āt ’tu*.
