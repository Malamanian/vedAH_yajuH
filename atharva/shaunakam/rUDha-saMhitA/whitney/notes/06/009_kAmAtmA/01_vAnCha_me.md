## Translation
1. Want (*vāñch*) thou the body of me, the feet; want the eyes; want the  
thighs; let the eyes, the hair of thee, lusting after me, dry up with  
love.

## Notes
Ppp. puts *tanvām* (not *-am*) after *pādāu* in **a**, reads *vāccha* in  
**b**, begins **c** with *akṣo*, adds *oṣṭhāu* after *keśās*, and ends  
with *āṣyatām*. Read *akṣyāù* in **c** in our text (an accent-sign  
omitted over the *āu*). ⌊Delbrück, *Vergleichende Syntax*, i.386, joins  
*mā́m* with *kā́mena:* so Grégoire, KZ. xxxv. 83.⌋
