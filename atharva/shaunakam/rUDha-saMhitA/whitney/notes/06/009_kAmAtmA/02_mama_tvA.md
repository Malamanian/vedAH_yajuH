## Translation
 2. I make thee cling to my arm, cling to my heart; that thou mayest be  
in my power, mayest come unto my intent.

## Notes
The second half-verse is the same with iii. 25. 5 **c, d**, and nearly  
so with i. 34. 2 **c, d** ⌊cf. vi. 42. 3, note⌋. Ppp. reads, for **a,  
b**, *māi tvā dūṣaṇimṛgaṁ kṛṇomi hṛdayaspṛgam;* and begins **c** with  
*mame ’d apa kr-*.
