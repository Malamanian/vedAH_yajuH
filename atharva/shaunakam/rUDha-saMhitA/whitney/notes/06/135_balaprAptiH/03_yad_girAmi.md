## Translation
3. When I swallow, I swallow up, a swallower-up like the ocean;  
swallowing up the breath of him yonder, we swallow him up.

## Notes
Ppp. reads, for **c, d**, *prāṇam amuṣya saṁgiraṁ saṁgirāmy ahaṁ giraṁ*.  
The accent *gírāmi* in our text is doubtless wrong (read *girā́mi*), but  
it is read by all the authorities, and accordingly is adopted in both  
editions.
