## Translation
3. Thou art the young (*gárbha*) of herbs; the young also of the snowy  
\[mountains\], the young of all existence; make thou this man free from  
disease for me.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The comm. understands the third verse as addressed to Agni; but much  
more probably the *kuṣṭha* is intended. From *garbho* in **c** the  
superfluous accent-mark above the line is to be deleted. ⌊Our **a, b,  
c** are nearly v. 25. 7 **a, b, c**; and **d** is nearly v. 4. 6 **c**.⌋
