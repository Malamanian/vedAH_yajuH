title = "०१ देवा अदुः"

## Translation
1. The gods have given, the sun has given, the sky has given, the earth  
has given, the three Sarasvatīs have given, accordant, the  
poison-spoiler.

## Notes
Ppp. combines *devā ’duḥ* in **a**, and has *sarvās* instead of *tīsras*  
in **c**. The comm. renders the first verb correctly, by *dattavantas*,  
but the others as imperatives.
