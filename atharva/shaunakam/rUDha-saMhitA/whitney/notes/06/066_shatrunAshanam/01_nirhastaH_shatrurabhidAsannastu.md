## Translation
1. Handless be the assailing foe—they who come with armies to fight us;  
make them, O Indra, collide with the great weapon; let their evildoer (?  
*aghahārá*) run (*drā*), pierced through.

## Notes
The comm. to SV. explains *aghahāra* by *atipratyavara;* ours, by  
*maraṇalakṣaṇasya duḥkhasya prāpayitā*.
