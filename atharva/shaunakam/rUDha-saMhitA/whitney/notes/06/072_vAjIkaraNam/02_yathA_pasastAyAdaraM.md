## Translation
2. As the member of the *tayādara* is made big by the wind—as great as  
is the member of the *párasvant*, so great let thy member grow.

## Notes
What creature the *parasvant* is is unknown (Pet. Lex. "perhaps the wild  
ass"); the *tayādara* is yet more obscure, being mentioned only here.  
The comm. reads *tāyodaram*, and defines the *tayodara* as 'a kind of  
animal'; the *bha* of *sthūlabha* he takes as representing a verbal  
root: *sthāulyena bhāsamānam*.
