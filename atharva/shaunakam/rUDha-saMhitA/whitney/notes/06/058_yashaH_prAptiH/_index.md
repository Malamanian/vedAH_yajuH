## Comment
Found also, except vs. 3, in Pāipp. xix. The hymn is reckoned (note to Kāuś. 13. 1) to the varcasya gaṇa, and is employed (59. 9) among the kāmya ceremonies by one desiring glory; also (139. 15), in the introduction to Vedic study (utsarjanakarmaṇi, comm.), it appears with various other hymns (vi. 38, 39, etc.), with an oblation to Agni.
