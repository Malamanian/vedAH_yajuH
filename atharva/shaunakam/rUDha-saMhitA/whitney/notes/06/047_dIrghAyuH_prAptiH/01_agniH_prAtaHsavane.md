## Translation
1. Let Agni at the morning libation (*sávana*) protect us, he that  
belongs to all men (*vāiśvānará*), all-maker, all-wealful; let him, the  
purifier, set us in property (*dráviṇa*); may we be long-lived, provided  
with draughts.

## Notes
Ppp. ends **b** with *pathikṛd viśvakṛṣṭiḥ*, and TS. has *mahinā́*, KśS.  
(ix. 3. 21) *mahīnām*, and MS. (i. 3. 36) *viśvaśrī́s*, for *viśvakṛ́t;*  
all have *dráviṇam* (for *-ṇe*) in **c**; and MS. reads *prātáḥ sávanāt*  
in **a**. ⌊As to the morning invocation of Agni, see Bloomfield, JAOS.  
xvi. 10.⌋ The comm. explains *sahábhakṣās* by *samānasomapānāḥ  
putrapāutrādibhiḥ sahabhojanā vā*.
