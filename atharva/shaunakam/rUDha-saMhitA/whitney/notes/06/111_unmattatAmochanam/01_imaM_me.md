## Translation
1. Free thou this man for me, O Agni, who here bound, well-restrained,  
cries loudly; thenceforth shall he make for thee a portion, when he  
shall be uncrazed.

## Notes
Nearly all our mss., and the great majority of SPP's, have the false  
accent *atás* at beginning of **c**; both editions give *átas*. The  
comm. reads *yathā* for *yadā* in **d**. The comm. paraphrases *suyatas*  
by *suṣṭhu niyamito niruddhaprasaraḥ san*. Pāda **b** has a redundant  
syllable.
