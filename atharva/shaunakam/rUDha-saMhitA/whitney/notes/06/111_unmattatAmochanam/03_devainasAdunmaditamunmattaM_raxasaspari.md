## Translation
3. Crazed from sin against the gods, crazed from a demon—I, knowing,  
make a remedy, when he shall be uncrazed.

## Notes
A few of the authorities (including our O.) accent *yádā* in **d**;  
*yáthā* would be a preferable reading. ⌊Bloomfield, "sin of the gods,"  
AJP. xvii. 433, JAOS., etc.⌋
