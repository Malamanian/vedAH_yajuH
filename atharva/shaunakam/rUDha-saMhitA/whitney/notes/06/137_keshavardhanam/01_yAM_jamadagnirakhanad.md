## Translation
1. \[The herb\] which Jamadagni dug for his daughter, \[as\]  
hair-increaser, that one Vītahavya brought from Asita's houses.

## Notes
Or *vītahavya* may be understood (with the Anukr.) as an epithet, 'after  
the gods had enjoyed his oblations.' The comm. takes it as a proper  
name, as also *ásitasya* (=*kṛṣṇakeśasyāi ’tatsaṁjñasya muneḥ*).
