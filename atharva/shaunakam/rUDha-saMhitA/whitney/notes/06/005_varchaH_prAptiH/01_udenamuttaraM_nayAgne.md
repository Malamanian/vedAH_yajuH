## Translation
1. Lead him up higher, O Agni, \[thou\] to whom oblations of ghee are  
made; unite him with splendor, and make him abundant with progeny.

## Notes
VS.TS. have in **a** the later form *uttarā́m*. In **b**, *ghṛténa*  
presents the rare case of an instrumental dependent on a vocative, and  
ought, like a genitive in the like construction, to be unaccented; it is  
so in all the three Yajus texts. Ppp. reads *ghṛtebhir āhutaḥ*. VS.TS.  
exchange 1 **c** and 2 **c**; and TS. has *dhánena ca* for *bahúṁ kṛdhi*  
at the end. Ppp. has, for **d**, *devānāṁ bhāgadhā asat* (cf. TS. 2  
**d**). This first verse occurs also in Āp. vi. 24. 8, which has, for  
**a**, *ud asmāṅ uttarān naya*, agrees with VS. and TS. in **c**, and  
reads *bahūn* in **d**.
