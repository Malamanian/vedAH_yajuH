title = "०२ पवमानः पुनातु"

## Translation
2. Let the purifying one purify me, in order to activity, dexterity,  
life, likewise unharmedness.

## Notes
Ppp. arranges **a** as *punātu mā pavamānaḥ*. It gives, for **c**, *jyok  
ca sūryaṁ dṛśe* (cf. our i. 6. 3 and xii. 2. 18), and this is also the  
reading of MS. (ib.), which alone of all the other texts has a  
correspondent to this verse.
