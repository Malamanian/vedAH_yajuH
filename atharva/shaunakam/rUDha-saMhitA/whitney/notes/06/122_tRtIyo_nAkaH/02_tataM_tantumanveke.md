## Translation
2. Some pass along the extended line, of whom what is the Fathers'  
\[was\] given in course (? *ā́yanena*); some, without relatives, giving,  
bestowing—if they be able to give, that is very heaven.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The TA. (ii. 6. 2⁶) has this verse also, with variants: *ánu sáṁcaranti*  
for *taranti* (besides the preceding *ánu*) in **a**, *ā́yanavat* at end  
of **b**, *-yácchāt* at end of **c** (Ppp. has *-yachān*),  
*śaknuvāṅsas*\* for *śíkṣān* and *eṣām* for *evá* in **d**. Both comm's  
understand *ṛṇám* 'debt' with *pítryam*, and *abandhú* (which appears to  
be used adverbially) as equivalent to *abandhavas:* though without  
descendants, they too reach heaven as reward of their gifts. Ppp. has  
also *te* for *cet* in **d**. \*⌊The Calc. ed. seems to have  
*śaknúvāṅsáḥ sv-*. Does it intend *caknúvān* (or *śaknávān*—see *Gram.*  
§701) *sá sv-*?⌋
