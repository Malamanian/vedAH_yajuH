title = "०२ शिवः कपोत"

## Translation
2. Propitious to us be the sent dove, harmless, O gods, the hawk  
(*śakuná*) \[sent\] to our house; for let the inspired (*vípra*) Agni  
enjoy our oblation, let the winged missile avoid us.

## Notes
Ppp. agrees with RV. in the better reading *gṛhéṣu* (for *gṛháṁ naḥ*) at  
end of **b**. ⌊One suspects that "hawk" may be too specific.⌋
