## Translation
1. This one, O ye associates (? *sadhástha*), I deliver to you, whom  
Jātavedas shall carry \[as\] a treasure; the sacrificer follows after  
well-being; him do ye recognize in the highest firmament.

## Notes
The verse is found also in VS. (xviii. 59) and K. (xl. 13). VS. reads,  
in **a**, *sadhastha* and *te* (for *vas*); in **b**, it puts *śevadhím*  
after *āváhāt;* in **c**, it reads *a. yajñápatir vo átra*. The comm.  
explains *sadhasthās* as meaning 'the gods' (*saha tiṣṭhanty ekatra  
svarge loke sthāne yajamānena saha nivasanti*).
