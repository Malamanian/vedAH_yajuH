## Translation
2. The two testicles that are thine, O *balā́sa*, laid away in thine  
armpit (? *kákṣa*)—I know the remedy for that, the *cīpúdru*, a  
looking-upon.

## Notes
By a blundering confusion of *c* and *ś* in transcription, in our text  
and in the *Index Verborum* founded upon it, the form *śīpúdru* instead  
of *cī-* has been adopted for this verse. The comm. reads *cīpadru*, and  
calls it "a kind of tree having this name"; perhaps *cīpúḍu* is the true  
form. We should have expected rather *úpa-* or *ápi-* than *ápaśritāu*  
in **b** (= *apakṛṣṭam āśritāu;* and *kakṣe* = *bāhumūle*, comm.).  
⌊"Testicles": perhaps swellings of the axillary "glands."⌋
