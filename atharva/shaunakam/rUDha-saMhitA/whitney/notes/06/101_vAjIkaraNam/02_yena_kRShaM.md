## Translation
2. Wherewith they invigorate one who is lean, wherewith they incite  
(*hi*) one who is ill—with that, O Brahmaṇaspati, make thou his member  
taut like a bow.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Our Bp. reads *vājayánti* in **a**. The second half-verse is nearly a  
repetition of iv. 4. 6 **c, d**. The comm. reads *vaśam* for *kṛśam* in  
**a**.
