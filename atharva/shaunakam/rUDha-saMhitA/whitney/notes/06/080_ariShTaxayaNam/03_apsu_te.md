## Translation
3. In the waters \[is\] thy birth, in heaven thy station, within the  
ocean thy greatness, on the earth; what the greatness is of the heavenly  
dog, with that oblation would we pay worship to thee.

## Notes
Ppp. substitutes ⌊for **c, d**⌋ again its own refrain, *sa no divy-*  
etc., as in vs. 1. The comm. regards the verse as addressed to Agni.
