## Translation
1. This head that is love's (? *preṇí*), virility given by Soma—by what  
is engendered out of that, do we pain (*śocaya*) thy heart.

## Notes
*Preṇí* is as obscure to the comm. as to us; he paraphrases it by  
*premaprāpaka* 'that obtains (or causes to obtain) affection.' He takes  
*vṛṣṇya* as adj., treats *pari prajātena* in **c** as one word, and  
supplies to it *snehaviśeṣeṣa*. ⌊Whitney's O. combines *tátas pári*.⌋
