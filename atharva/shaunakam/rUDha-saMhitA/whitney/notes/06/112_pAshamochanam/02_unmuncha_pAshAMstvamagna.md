## Translation
2. Do thou, O Agni, loosen up the bonds of them, the three with which  
they three were tied up; do thou, foreknowing, unfasten the bonds of the  
seizure; free all—father, son, mother.

## Notes
The comm. reads *utthitās* for *utsitās* in **b**; the word is,  
strangely, not divided into *út॰sitāḥ* in the *pada*-text, which  
⌊non-division⌋ would be proper treatment for *útthtās*, and part of the  
mss. (including our H.I.O.) read *útthitās*. The second half-verse is  
wanting in Ppp. (save as **d** is found in it as 1 **d**: see above).
