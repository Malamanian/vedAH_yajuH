## Translation
2. Let them release here the worked-in waters of the ceremony for  
conducting forward; let them at once make \[them\] to go.

## Notes
The translation implies emendation of *ā́pas* in **a** to *apás*, or else  
the use of the former as accusative, as in more than one other passage.  
*Ótās*, lit. 'woven in': i.e. brought in as part of the ceremony. But  
the comm. reads *ūtās*, and explains it as = *saṁtatās* or *avicchedena  
pravahantyaḥ*. ⌊In **a, b**, the reading of Ppp. appears to be like  
ours; but in **c** it has *bhavantu etave*.⌋ ⌊Cf. v. 23. 1 for *ótās*.⌋
