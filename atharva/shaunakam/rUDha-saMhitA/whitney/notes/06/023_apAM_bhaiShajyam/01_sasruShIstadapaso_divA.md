## Translation
1. Flowing on, devoted to it; by day and by night flowing on; I, of  
desirable activity, call upon the heavenly waters.

## Notes
The verse is found as a *khila* or appendix to RV. x. 9, as vs. 10 of  
that hymn. It reads there, in **a**, *tádapasas*, which is an obvious  
and called-for emendation of our text, and assumed in our translation;  
in **c**, *-kratūs*, which is also an improvement (our P. has it, but  
apparently only by an accident); and, for **d**, *ā́ devī́r ávase huve*.  
Ppp. has, for **d**, *ahūpo devīr upa bruve*. The first pāda lacks a  
syllable, unless we resolve *sa-sṛ-u-*.
