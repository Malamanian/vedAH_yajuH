## Translation
3. Let not the seers who are of the gods leave us, who are self  
(*tanū́*) protecting, self-born of our self; O immortal ones, attach  
yourselves to us mortals; grant life-time (*ā́yus*) in order to our  
further living.

## Notes
With the first line is to be compared AB. ii. 27. 7: *ṛṣayo dāivyāsas  
tanūpāvānas tanvas tapojāḥ* (Florenz). *Tanū* (lit. 'body') 'self'  
apparently refers throughout to ourselves. This verse is translated by  
Muir, OST. v. 296. ⌊*Mā́ hāsiṣur ṛ́ṣayo dāíviā naḥ* would make good  
meter.⌋  
  
The fourth *anuvāka* ends here, having 10 hymns and 33 verses; and the  
old Anukr. says of it and its predecessor together *tṛtīyacaturthāu  
trayastriṅśakāu* (*tṛtīya-* given above, not here).
