## Translation
1. Within the flame, pray, make ye this sorcerer-destroying libation  
with ghee; from afar, O Agni, do thou burn against the demons; mayest  
thou not be hot toward our houses.

## Notes
Our mss. (so far as noted) and nearly all SPP's, accent *juhutā́* in  
**a**; but his text, as well as ours, emends to *juhutā*. The comm.  
understands at the beginning *antar dāve* as two separate words; and  
that is a preferable, and probably the true, reading. The gen. in **d**  
is peculiar; we should expect with it *tītapāti*, in impers. sense: 'may  
there be no sickness befalling our houses.' Ppp. reads *ghṛhaṁ naḥ* at  
end of **b**; and, for **d**, *mā ’smākaṁ vasū ’pa tītipanthā*. The  
verse (10 + 10: 12 + 11 = 43) is ill-defined as a mere *triṣṭubh*.
