## Translation
1. From the sky now, from the great atmosphere, a drop of water hath  
fallen upon me with essence (*rása*); with Indra's power, with milk, O  
Agni, \[may\] I \[be joined\], with the meters, with offerings, with the  
deed of the well-doing.

## Notes
The verse is found also in HGS. i. 16.6, with sundry variants: *mā* for  
*mām* in **a**; *apatac chivāya* at end of **b**; in **c, d**, *manasā  
’ham ā ’gām brahmaṇā guptaḥ sukṛtā kṛtena;* these are in some respects  
improvements, especially in relieving the embarassing lack of a verb in  
our second half-verse. The comm. paraphrases *antarikṣāt* by *ākāśān  
nirmeghāt*, and supplies *saṁgaccheya* (as in the translation). It is a  
little strange that the fall of water out of the air upon one is so  
uncanny and must be atoned for (*ākāśodakaplāvanadoṣaśānti*).
