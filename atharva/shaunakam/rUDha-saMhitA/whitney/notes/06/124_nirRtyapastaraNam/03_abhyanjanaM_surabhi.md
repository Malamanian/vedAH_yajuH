## Translation
3. A fragrant ointment, a success is that; gold, splendor, just  
purifying is that. All purifiers \[are\] stretched out from us; let not  
perdition pass that, nor the niggard.

## Notes
That is, the uncanny drop is all these fine things. The comm. renders  
*pútrimam* in **b** by *śuddhikaram;* and *adhi* in **c** by "above."  
The second pāda is redundant by a syllable.  
  
With this ends the twelfth *anuvāka*, of 11 hymns and 38 verses; the old  
Anukr. says *aṣṭariṅśo dvādaśaḥ*.
