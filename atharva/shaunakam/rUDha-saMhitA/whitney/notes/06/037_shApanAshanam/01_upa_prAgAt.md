## Translation
1. Hither hath come forth, having harnessed his chariot, the  
thousand-eyed curse, seeking after my curser, as a wolf the house of a  
sheepowner.

## Notes
Ppp. has, in **a**, *abhi* (which is better) for *upa;* in **c**, *yāti*  
for *mama;* and, in **d**, it combines *vṛkāi ’va*—which contraction the  
Anukr. appears to ratify. *Yuktvā́ya* would fill out **b** more  
acceptably.
