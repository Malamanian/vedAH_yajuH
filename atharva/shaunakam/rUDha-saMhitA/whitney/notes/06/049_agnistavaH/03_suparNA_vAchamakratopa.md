## Translation
3. The eagles have uttered (*kṛ*) their voice close in the sky; in the  
lair (*ākhará*) the black lively ones have danced; when they come down  
to the removal of the lower \[stone\], they have assumed much seed, they  
that resort to the sun.

## Notes
In **c**, RV. has *nyàn̄* (p. *nyàk*) *ní yanti*, for which our reading  
is evidently a corruption—as is probably also *níṣkṛtim* for RV.  
*niṣkṛtám*, and *sūryaśrítas* for RV. *-śvítas* at the end. The comm.  
has *divi* instead of *dyavi* in **a**. Ppp. has a very original **d**:  
*puro vāco dadhire sūryasya*. There is no reason for reckoning this  
*jagatī* as *virāj*.
