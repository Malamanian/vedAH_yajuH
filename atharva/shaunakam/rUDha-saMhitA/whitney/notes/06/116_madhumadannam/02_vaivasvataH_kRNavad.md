title = "०२ वैवस्वतः कृणवद्"

## Translation
2. Vivasvant's son shall make \[us\] an apportionment; having a portion  
of sweet, he shall unite \[us\] with sweet—whatever sin of \[our\]  
mother's, sent forth, hath come to us, or what \[our\] father,  
wronged,\* hath done in wrath.

## Notes
For *bhāgadheyam* in **a**, Ppp. reads *bheṣajāni*. The two half-verses  
hardly belong together. The comm. explains *aparāddhas* by  
*asmatkṛtāparādhena vimukhaḥ san*. \*⌊In his ms. Whitney wrote "guilty"  
(which seems much better) and then changed it to "wronged."⌋
