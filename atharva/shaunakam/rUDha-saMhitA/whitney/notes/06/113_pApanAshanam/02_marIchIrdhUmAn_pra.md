## Translation
2. Enter thou after the beams, the smokes, O evil; go unto the mists or  
also the fogs; disappear along those foams of the rivers: wipe off  
difficulties, O Pūshan, on the embryo-slayer.

## Notes
The last pāda is a repetition of 112. 3 **d**, and discordant with the  
rest of the verse. Some of SPP's authorities read *naśyan* at end of  
**c**. The comm. has instead *vikṣva*. The comm. explains *marīcīr* by  
*agnisūryādiprabhāviśeṣān, udārān* by *ūrdhvaṁ gatān meghātmanā  
pariṇatāṅs tān* (*dhūmān*), and *nīhārān* by *tajjanyān avaśyāyān*.
