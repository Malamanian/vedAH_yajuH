## Translation
1. An overcomer (*abhibhū́*) \[is\] the sacrifice, an overcomer Agni, an  
overcomer Soma, an overcomer Indra; that I may overcome (*abhi-as*) all  
fighters, so would we, Agni-offerers, pay worship with this oblation.

## Notes
The comm. paraphrases *agnihotrās* by *agnāu juhvataḥ*. ⌊The Anukr.  
balances the deficiencies of **a, b** by the redundancies of **c, d**.⌋
