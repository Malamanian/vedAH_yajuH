## Translation
2. Whatever ill-famed one, O Soma, shall aim at us of good fame, smite  
upon his face with the thunderbolt; may he go away crushed (*sam-piṣ*).

## Notes
Notwithstanding the direct antithesis with *duḥśáṅsa*, all the mss. in  
**a** read *susaṅśínas;* both editions emend to *suśáṅsínas*, which is  
also read by Ppp., and by the commentary. ⌊Unless I misunderstand R's  
note, Ppp. again reads *abhidāsati* at end of **b**. In **d**, SPP's  
*áyati* is a misprint for *ayati*.⌋
