## Translation
1. Down (*áva*) \[be\] the fury, down the drawn \[arrow\], down the two  
mind-yoked arms. O demolisher (*parāśará*), do thou vex (*ard*) away the  
vehemence (*śúṣma*) of them; then get us wealth.

## Notes
One can hardly help emending *manyús* in **a** to *dhánus* 'bow.' For  
*ā́yatā* used pregnantly of an arrow ready to be launched, cf. vi. 38. 4  
and xi. 2. 1 and vi. 66. 2. The combined idea of crushing and removing  
in *parāśara* cannot be briefly rendered; the comm. regards it as an  
epithet of Indra. For *adhā nas* in **e**, Ppp- reads better *arvāñcam*,  
as antithesis to *parāñcam;* the comm. has *atha* instead of *adha*.
