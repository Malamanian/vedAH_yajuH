## Translation
2. What was known of old by priests (*brahmán*), what by seers, what by  
gods; what is (*bhūtá*), is to be, that has a mouth—therewith do I ward  
off thy poison.

## Notes
Ppp. has *uditam* for *viditam* in **b**, and *āsunvat* at end of **c**.  
The comm. explains *āsanvat* to mean *āsyayuktaṁ: teno  
’ccāryamāṇamantrasahitam*.
