## Translation
1. As this great earth receives the embryo of existences, so let thine  
embryo be maintained, in order to birth after pregnancy.

## Notes
The comm. reads *anusūtram* for *ánu sū́tum*. The first half-verse has  
already occurred, as v. 25. 2 **a, b** ⌊where the note gives the  
parallel passages⌋. The comment to Prāt. ii. 103 notes the  
non-lingualization of the *s* of *sū́tum* after *ánu*—which is wholly  
superfluous unless it read *ánusūtum*.
