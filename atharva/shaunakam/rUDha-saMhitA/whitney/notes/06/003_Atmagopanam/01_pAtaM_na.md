## Translation
1. Protect us, O Indra-and-Pūshan; let Aditi, let the Maruts protect; O  
child of the waters, ye seven rivers, protect; let Vishṇu protect us,  
also the heaven.

## Notes
The accent of **c** is in part against all rule and analogy, and  
doubtless corrupt; we ought to read *síndhavaḥ sapta pātána*.
