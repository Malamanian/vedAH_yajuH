## Translation
2. Let heaven-and-earth protect us in order to assistance (*abhíṣṭi*);  
let the pressing-stone protect, let Soma protect us from distress; let  
the fortunate goddess Sarasvatī protect us; let Agni protect us—the  
propitious protections that are his.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Ppp. has *suhavā* instead of *subhagā* in **c**. The comm. explains  
*abhiṣṭaye* by *abhyeṣaṇāya* (taking it from root *iṣ*) or  
*abhimataphalaprāptaye*. In **c**, *devó* in our edition is a misprint  
for *devī́*.
