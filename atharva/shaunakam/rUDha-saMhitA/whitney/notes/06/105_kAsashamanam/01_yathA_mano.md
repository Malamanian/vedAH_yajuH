## Translation
1. As the mind with mind-aims flies away swiftly, so do thou, O cough,  
fly forth, after the forth-driving (?) of the mind.

## Notes
The comm. paraphrases *manasketāis* with *manasā buddhivṛttyā  
ketyamānāir jñāyamānāir dūrasthāir viṣayāiḥ;* and the obscure  
*pravāyyam* with *pragantavyam avadhim*.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
    
2 As the well-sharpened arrow flies away swiftly, so do thou, O cough,  
fly forth, after the stretch (?) of the earth.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
The comm. explains *saṁvat* by *saṁhatapradeśa*, which at least shows  
his perplexity.
