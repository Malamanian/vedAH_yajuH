## Translation
3. Be ye just here; go not away from us; let Pūshan make \[it\] pathless  
for you in the distance; let the lord of the dwelling (*vā́stu*) call  
aloud after you; in me, O \[my\] fellows, be your satisfaction.

## Notes
Ppp. has, in **a**, *e ’ha yāta mā ’pa*, at the beginning; it rectifies  
the meter of **b** by omitting *vas;* in **c**, it reads *‘yam ahvan*  
for *johavītu;* in **d**, it again has *sujātās*.
