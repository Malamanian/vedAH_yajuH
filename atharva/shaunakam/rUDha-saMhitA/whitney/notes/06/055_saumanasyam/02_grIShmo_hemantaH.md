## Translation
2. Hot season, winter, cool season, spring, autumn, rains—do ye set us  
in welfare (*svitá*); portion ye us in kine, in progeny; may we verily  
be in your windless shelter.

## Notes
TS. and MB. (ii. 1. 11) read *utá nas* for *śíśiras* in **a**, end **b**  
with *suvitáṁ no astu*, and have, for **c, d**, *téṣām ṛtūṇā́ḿ  
śatáśāradānāṁ nivātá eṣām ábhaye syāma*. ⌊See also MGS. ii. 8. 6 **a**,  
and p. 158, s.v. *hemanto*. PGS. (iii. 2. 2) follows TS. except that it  
ends with *vasema* and has for **b** *śivā varṣā abhayā śaran naḥ*.⌋
