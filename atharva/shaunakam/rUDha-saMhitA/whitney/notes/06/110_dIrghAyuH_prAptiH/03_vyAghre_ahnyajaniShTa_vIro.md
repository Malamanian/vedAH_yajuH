## Translation
3. On the tiger day hath been born the hero, asterism-born, being born  
rich in heroes; let him not, increasing, slay his father; let him not  
harm his mother that gave him birth.

## Notes
We should expect at the beginning *vyāghryé* or *vāíyāghre;* the comm.  
paraphrases the word with *vyāghravat krūre*. ⌊In **d**, read *sá mā́  
mātáram?*—As to *minīt*, see *Gram.* §726.⌋
