## Translation
3. Let thy body, O steed, conducting a body, run pleasance (*vāmá*) for  
us, protection for thyself; uninjured, great, a god for maintaining, may  
he set up his own light in the sky, as it were.

## Notes
This is translated literally according to the AV. text, although  
comparison with the corresponding RV. verse (x. 56. 2) shows that its  
readings are in part pure corruptions. So, in **b**, RV. makes ⌊the  
meter good and⌋ the sense easy by giving *dhā́tu* for *dhā́vatu;* in **c**  
it has *devā́n* for *devā́s* (the comm. gives instead *divas*); and, in  
**d**, *mimīyās* (*ā́ mimīyāt* = *āgacchatu*, comm.). Ppp. has, for  
**a**, *aste vājiṅ tanvaṁ vahantu;* in **c**, *avihvṛtas;* in **d**,  
*svarānasīvām*. The verse is probably originally addressed to Agni, and  
added here only because of the occurrence of *vājin* at its beginning.  
The comm. understands *tanvàm* in **a** of a rider: *ārūḍhasya sādinaḥ  
śarīram*.  
  
The ninth *anuvāka*, of 10 hymns and 32 verses, ends here; the old  
Anukr. is thus quoted: *dvyadhikāv apacit*.
