## Translation
3. What food I eat unrighteously, O gods, and promise, intending to give  
\[or\] not intending to give—by the greatness of the great Vāiśvānara  
let \[it\] be propitious honeyed food for me.

## Notes
TA. (11. 6. 2¹¹) has the first half-verse, adding the same three pādas  
as above (see under vs. 1). For the doubtful *saṁgṛṇā́mi* it reads *vā  
kariṣyán*, and Ppp. has the same, also omitting (perhaps by accident)  
*ádāsyan*. The second pāda is nearly repeated as 119. 1 **b**, below.  
The comm. renders *saṁgṛṇāmi* by *pratijānāmi*. The Daś. Kar. cites (to  
Kāuś. 57. 29: see the note to that rule) the three verses in full, but  
substitutes for 3 **c, d** our 53. 2 **c, d**, *vāiśvānaro no ad-*, etc.
