## Translation
1. They flow forth from the snowy (mountain); in the Indus somewhere  
\[is their\] gathering; may the heavenly waters give to me that remedy  
for heart-burn.

## Notes
Ppp. reads, for **a, b**, *himavataḥ prasravatas tās sindhum  
upagachataḥ*. In **d**, the true reading is of course *hṛddyo-*, and  
SPP. so reads, though doubtless against his mss., as certainly against  
all ours; it is a very rare thing to find the full form written in such  
a case (and hence the *pada*-text blunder *hṛ-dyota* in i. 22. 1).
