## Translation
2. Whatever hath burnt (*ā-dyut*) in my eyes, and what in my heels, my  
front feet; may the waters remove all that—they of physicians the most  
excellent physicians.

## Notes
The collocation of suffering parts in *a, b* is very odd; Ppp. seems to  
read for **a**, *yad akṣibhyām ād-*, and, for **b**, *pārṣṇibhyāṁ  
hṛdayena ca;* for **d**, *tvaṣṭā riṣṭam ivā ’nasaḥ*. One or two of our  
mss. (P.H.) agree with some of SPP's in reading *karat* at end of **c**;  
and two of his have *níḥ* before it. The *pada*-division *subhiṣak॰tama*  
is taught in Prāt. iv. 46.
