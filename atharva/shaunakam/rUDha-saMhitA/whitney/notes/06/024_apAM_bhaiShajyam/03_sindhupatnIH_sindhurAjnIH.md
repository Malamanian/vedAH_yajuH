title = "०३ सिन्धुपत्नीः सिन्धुराज्ञीः"

## Translation
3. Ye whose spouse is the Indus, whose king is the Indus, all ye streams  
that are—give us the remedy for this; for that would we enjoy you.

## Notes
Ppp. exchanges the place of the two epithets in **a**. The comm. reads  
*stana* at end of **b**. Before *sthána* most of our mss. retain the  
final *ḥ*, as usual; SPP. does not note anything as to his authorities.
