title = "०१ सं जानीध्वं"

## Translation
1. Do ye concur; be ye closely combined; let your minds be concurrent,  
as the gods of old sat concurrent about their portion.

## Notes
The other texts begin *sáṁ gachadhvaṁ sáṁ vadadhvam* (but MS.  
*jānīdhvam*); at the end, TB. reads (if it be not a misprint) *upā́sata;*  
the *pū́rve* gives, at any rate, a past meaning to *-te*.  
  
⌊Poona ed. has *-ata*.⌋
