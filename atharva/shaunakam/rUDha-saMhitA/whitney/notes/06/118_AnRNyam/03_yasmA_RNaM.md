title = "०३ यस्मा ऋणं"

## Translation
3. To whom \[I owe\] debt, whose wife I approach, to whom I go begging  
(*yāc*), O gods—let them not speak words superior to me; ye (two)  
Apsarases, wives of gods, take notice!

## Notes
Ppp. has a different version (mostly corrupt) of **b, c, d**: *yaṁ  
yājamānāu abhyetnahe: vāte vājin vājibhir mo ’ttarām mad devapatnī  
apsarasāpadītam*. The comm. reads *abhyemi* in **b**. By analogy with  
*abhyāími*, the *pada*-text understands *upāími* as *upa-āími* in **a**.  
Our *pada*-mss. also leave *mā* unaccented in **c**. The comm.  
paraphrases *adhī ’tam* with *madvijñāpanaṁ citte ‘vadhārayatam*.
