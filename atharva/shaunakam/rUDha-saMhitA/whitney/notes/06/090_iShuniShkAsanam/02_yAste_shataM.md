## Translation
2. The hundred tubes that are thine, distributed along thy limbs, of all  
these of thine do we call out the poisons.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *hirās* for *śatam* in **a**, and *sākam* for *vayam* in  
**c**. The comm. takes *nirviṣāṇi* as a single word in **d** (=  
*viṣarahitāni*). ⌊Cf. i. 17. 3.⌋
