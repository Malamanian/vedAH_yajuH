## Translation
3. If (*yát*) thou runnest three leagues, five leagues, a horseman's  
day's journey, thence shalt thou come back; thou shalt be father of our  
sons.

## Notes
The proper division of *ā́yasi* in **c** is doubtless *ā́: ayasi*, which  
is, however, read only by one of SPP's *pada*-mss.; the others give  
*ā॰áyasi* (cf. *ā॰áyati* at vi. 60. 2) or *ā́॰ayasi*, and this last is  
adopted by SPP.—quite unaccountably, since such accent and such division  
do not properly go together in any *pada*-text.
