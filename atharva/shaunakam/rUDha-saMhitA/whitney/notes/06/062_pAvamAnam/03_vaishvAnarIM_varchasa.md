## Translation
3. Take ye hold upon that (f.) of Vāiśvānara in order to splendor,  
becoming cleansed, clear, purifying; here, reveling in joint reveling  
with Iḍā, may we long see the sun going up.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The first half-verse is nearly identical with xii. 2. 28 **a, b**. Durga  
to Nir. vi. 12 (Calcutta ed'n, iii. 187) quotes *vāiśvadevīṁ sūnṛtām ā  
rabhadhvam*, showing that *sūnṛta* is meant here also, as in vs. 2. Ppp.  
reads in **a** *vaiśvānaryaṁ*, combines *varcasā ”rabh-*; ⌊has for **b**  
our 2 **b**, combining *yasyā ”śās;*⌋ and begins **c** with *īḍe ’ha  
sadh-*.
