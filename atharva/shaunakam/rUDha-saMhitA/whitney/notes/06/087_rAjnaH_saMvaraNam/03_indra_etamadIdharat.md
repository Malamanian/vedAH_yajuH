## Translation
3. Indra hath maintained this man fixed by a fixed oblation; him may  
Soma bless, and Brahmaṇaspati here.

## Notes
RV. begins *imám índro ad-*, and has, in **d**, *tásmā u* for *ayáṁ ca*.  
TB. (also ĀpśS. xiv. 27. 7, which agrees with it throughout ⌊except  
*bruvan* for *bravan*⌋) has *eṇam* for *etám* in **a**, and *tásmāi devā́  
ádhi bravan* for **c**. ⌊Our **c, d** occurred above, 5. 3 **c, d**.⌋
