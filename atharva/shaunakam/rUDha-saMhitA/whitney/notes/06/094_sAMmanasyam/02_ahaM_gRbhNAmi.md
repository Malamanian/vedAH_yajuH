## Translation
2. I seize \[your\] minds with \[my\] mind; come after my intent with  
\[your\] intents; I put your hearts in my control; come with \[your\]  
tracks following my motion.

## Notes
These two verses are a repetition of iii. 8. 5, 6. In our text, *-rete*  
at the end of **b** is a misprint for *reta*. ⌊As to the meter, see note  
to iii. 8. 6.⌋
