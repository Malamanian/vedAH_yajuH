## Translation
1. Chief (*vṛ́ṣan*) of Indra, chief of heaven, chief of earth is this  
man, chief of all existence; do thou be sole chief.

## Notes
"Chief," lit'ly 'bull': foremost, as the bull is of the herd. *Indrasya*  
in **a** can hardly stand; rather *āindrasya*, or, we may conjecture,  
*īdhrasya* (cf. *īdhriya, vīdhra*).
