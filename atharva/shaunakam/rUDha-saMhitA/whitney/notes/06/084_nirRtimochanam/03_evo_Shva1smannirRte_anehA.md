## Translation
3. So, O perdition, do thou, free from envy, kindly unfasten from us the  
bond-fetters of iron. Yama verily giveth thee back to me; to that Yama,  
to death, be homage.

## Notes
All of this verse except the first *pāda* is a repetition of 63. 2 **b,  
c, d**, above. The comm. explains *anehā* by *anāhantrī*. The fourth is  
the only *jagatī* pāda.
