## Translation
2. Fix thou the old ones, generate those unborn, and make longer those  
born.

## Notes
The comm. strangely divides vss. 2 and 3 differently, adding 3 **a, b**  
to 2, and leaving 3 **c, d** to form by themselves a verse. ⌊The Anukr.  
scans as 9 + 9. The "verse" seems to be prose.⌋
