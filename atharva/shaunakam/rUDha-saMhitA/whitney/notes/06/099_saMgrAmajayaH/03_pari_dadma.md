## Translation
3. We put completely about the two arms of Indra the savior; let him  
save us. God Savitar! king Soma! make thou me well-willing, in order to  
well-being.

## Notes
In this verse, only our Bp.M. read *dadhmas*, but it is adopted in our  
text. The comm. again gives it. Ppp. has *dadmān;* and in **d** it  
reads, for *kṛṇu, kṛṇutam*, which is preferable for sense, though it  
makes the verse still less metrical. The verse is *bṛhatī* only by  
count.
