## Translation
3. Whoever scathes, him seek thou after; whoever scathes, him smite; the  
crown of the scather, O thunderbolt, do thou cause to fall following  
after.

## Notes
The last pāda is very obscure; it is rendered as if it meant an  
involving of the offender's crown (*sīmanta:=śiraso madhyadeśa*, comm.)  
in the fall of the thunderbolt (but the comm. explains *anvañcam* by  
*anulomam!*). Ppp. reads *sāyakas* for *tvam* in **c**. The Prāt, gives  
an *obiter dictum* (iii. 43) on the derivation of *sīmánta* (or  
*sīmánt*). The metrical definition ⌊bhurig anuṣṭup⌋ seems to be omitted  
in the Anukr.
