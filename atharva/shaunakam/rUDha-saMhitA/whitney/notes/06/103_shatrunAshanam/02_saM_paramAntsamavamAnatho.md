## Translation
2. I tie together the highest, together the lowest, also together the  
middle ones; Indra hath encompassed them with a tie; do thou, Agni, tie  
them together.

## Notes
The comm. reads *paramām, avamām*, and *madhyamām* in **a, b**,  
supplying *śatrusenām* in each case. ⌊The *r* of *ahār* is prescribed by  
Prāt. ii. 46.J⌋
