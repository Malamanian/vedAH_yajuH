## Translation
4. The two god-made tubes that \[are\] thine, in which stands thy  
virility, those I split for thee with a peg, on yon woman's loins  
(*muṣká*).

## Notes
Ppp. combines *amuṣyā ’dhi* in **d** (but perhaps the true  
*saṁhitā*-reading?). ⌊Ppp. has a gap in the place where our *śamyayā*  
stands.⌋
