## Translation
1. Thou art listened to, O herb, as the most best of plants; make thou  
now this man for me impotent (*klībá*), *opaśá*-wearing.

## Notes
The *opaśá* is some head-ornament worn distinctively by women (comm.  
*strīvyañjanam*). Geldner holds that *opaśa*, *kurīra* (vs. 2), and  
*kumba* (vs. 3) all mean alike 'horn.' Ppp. reads *pāuruṣam* in **c**.  
The comm. does not attempt to identify the plant addressed.
