## Translation
2. Homage be to the black \[snake\], homage to the cross-lined, homage  
to the brown constrictor; homage to the god-people.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *haye* for *astu* in **a**. The comm. explains *svaja*  
'constrictor' as "self-born" ⌊and Aufrecht as the "natural" color, that  
is, "green "⌋.
