## Translation
1. To Vāiśvānara, the righteous, lord of right, of light, we pray for  
unfailing heat (*gharmá*).

## Notes
The Sāman version, as also that in VS. (xxvi. 6), in MS. (iv. 11. 1),  
and AśS. (viii. 10. 3), is precisely accordant with ours; that in śśS.  
(iii. 3. 5) has *bhānum* instead of *gharmám* in **c**.
