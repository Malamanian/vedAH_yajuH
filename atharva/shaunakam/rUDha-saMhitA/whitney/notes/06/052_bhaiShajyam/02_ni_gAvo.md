title = "०२ नि गावो"

## Translation
2. The kine have sat down in the stall; the wild beasts have gone to  
rest (*ni-viś*); the waves of the streams, the unseen ones, have  
disappeared (*ni-lip*).

## Notes
For **c**, RV. has *ní ketávo jánānām*, and again Ppp. agrees with it.  
The comm. takes *alipsata* as impf. of the desiderative of root *labh*  
(*nitarāṁ labdhum āicchati*)!
