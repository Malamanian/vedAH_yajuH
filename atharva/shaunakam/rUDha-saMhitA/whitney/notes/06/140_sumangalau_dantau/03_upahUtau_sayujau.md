## Translation
3. Invoked \[are\] the two conjoint, pleasant, very propitious teeth;  
let what is terrible of your selves (*tanū́*) go away elsewhere, ye  
teeth; do not injure father and mother.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *aghorāu sayujā saṁvidānāu*, and adds at the end *anyatra vāṁ  
tanvo ghoratn astu*. The comm. reads *tanvās* in **c**. The definition  
of the Anukr. fits the verse (7 + 8: 13 + 11) very ill. ⌊Whitney's notes  
show that he had suspected *sayújāu* to be a misreading for *suyújāu*,  
and the latter is the form actually given by the *Index Verborum;* but  
further notes show that Bp. and the Anukr. read *sa-*. With them agree  
SPP. and the comm. and Ppp. Correct the *Index* accordingly.⌋
