## Translation
2. In the male, indeed, grows (*bhū*) the seed; that is poured along  
into the woman; that verily is the obtainment of a son; that Prajāpati  
said.

## Notes
Several of our mss. (Bp.P.M.W.E.H.) read *pūṁsí* at the beginning. śGS.  
has (i. 19) a nearly corresponding verse: *puṁsi vāi puruṣe retas tat  
striyām anu ṣiñcatu: tathā tad abravīd dhātā tat prajāpatir abravīt*.
