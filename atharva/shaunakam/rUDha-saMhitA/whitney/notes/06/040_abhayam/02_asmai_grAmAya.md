## Translation
2. For this village \[let\] the four directions—let Savitar make for us  
sustenance, well-being, welfare; let Indra make for us freedom from  
foes, fearlessness; let the fury of kings fall on (*abhi-yā*) elsewhere.

## Notes
Ppp. rectifies the redundancy of **b** by reading *subhūtaṁ savitā  
dadhātu;* in **c**, it reads *aśatrum* and omits *nas;* for **d**, it  
has *madhye ca viṣāṁ sukṛte syāma*. The comm. reads *aśatrus* in **c**.
