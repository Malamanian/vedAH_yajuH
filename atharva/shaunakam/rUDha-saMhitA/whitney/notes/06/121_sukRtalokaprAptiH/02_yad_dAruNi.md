## Translation
2. If (*yát*) thou art bound in wood, and if in a rope; if thou art  
bound in the earth, and if by a spell (*vā́c*)—may this  
householder's-fire lead us up from that to the world of the well-done.

## Notes
The second half-verse here is the same with 120. 1 **c, d**, and seems  
unconnected with the first half. Ppp. reads, in **a**, *dāruṇā* and  
*rajvā*, and omits the second half-verse, thus reducing the hymn to  
three verses, the norm of the book.
