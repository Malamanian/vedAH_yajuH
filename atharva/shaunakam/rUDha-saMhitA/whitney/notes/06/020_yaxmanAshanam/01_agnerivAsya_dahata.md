## Translation
1. Of him as of burning fire goeth the vehemence (?); likewise, as it  
were, shall he crying out go away from me; some other one than us let  
the ill-behaved one seek; homage be to the heat-weaponed fever.

## Notes
The translation given implies the easy emendation of *śuṣmíṇas* to  
*śúṣmas*, which eases the meter,\* and helps the sense out of a notable  
difficulty. The comm. and the translators understand (perhaps  
preferably) *mattás* in **b** as pple of *mad*, instead of  
quasi-ablative of the pronoun *ma*, as here rendered ("he flees, crying  
like a madman," R.). The comm. takes *avratas* as intended for an  
accusative, *-tam*. The verse is really a *jagatī* with one redundant  
syllable in **a**. \*⌊The metrical difficulty is in the prior part of  
**a**; the cadence of **a** is equally good with *śuṣmíṇas* or with  
*śúṣmas*.⌋
