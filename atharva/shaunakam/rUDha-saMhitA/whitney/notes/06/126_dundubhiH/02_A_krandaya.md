## Translation
2. Resound thou at \[them\]; mayest thou assign strength \[and\] force  
to us; thunder against \[them\], forcing off difficulties; drive, O  
drum, misfortune away from here; Indra's fist art thou; be stout.

## Notes
The other texts have, in **b**, *níḥ ṣṭanihi* for *abhi ṣṭana*, and, in  
**c**, *protha* for *sedha*, and the plural *duchúnās* (save TS., which  
gives -*nāṅ*, in *pada*-text *-nān*).
