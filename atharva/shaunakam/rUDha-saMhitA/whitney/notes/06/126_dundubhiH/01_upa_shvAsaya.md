## Translation
1. Blast thou unto heaven and earth; in many places let them win for  
thee the scattered living creatures (*jágat*); do thou, O drum, allied  
with Indra \[and\] the gods, drive away our foes further than far.

## Notes
The second pāda is translated according to the reading of our text,  
whose *vanvatām*, however, can hardly be otherwise than a corruption of  
the *manutām* of the other texts; Ppp. has instead *sunutām*, which is  
yet worse; the comm. has *vanutām*. MS. has, in **d**, *ārā́t for*  
dūrā́t*.*
