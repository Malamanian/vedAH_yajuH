title = "६६ यद् दुष्कृतं"

## Translation
66. What ill deed, what pollution at the wedding, and what on the bridal  
car—that difficulty do we wipe off on the dress (*kambalá*) of the  
wooer.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Ppp. reads in **c** *sambharasya*. Kāuś. 76. 1 makes the verse accompany  
the rubbing of the bride dry after the bath with a garment, which is  
then carried to the woods and fastened to a tree.
