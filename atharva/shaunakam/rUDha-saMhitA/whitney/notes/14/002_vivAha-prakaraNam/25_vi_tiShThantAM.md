## Translation
25. Let there come forth (*vi-sthā*) from the lap of this mother animals  
(*paśú*) of various forms, being born; as one of excellent omen, sit  
thou by this fire; with thy husband (*sámpatnī*), be thou serviceable to  
the gods here.

## Notes
In Kāuś. 78. 9 this verse accompanies the removal of the boy again from  
the bride's lap. The verse is a pure *triṣṭubh*. ⌊W. pencils the note  
"cf. K. xxxix. 10."⌋
