title = "०३ सोमस्य जाया"

## Translation
3. Soma's wife first; the Gandharva thy next husband; Agni thy third  
husband; thy fourth, one of human birth.

## Notes
The verse is RV. x. 85. 40, which, however, has for **a, b** *sómaḥ  
prathamó vivide gandharvó vivida úttaraḥ*. It is found also in PGS. (i.  
4. 16) and HGS. (i. 20. 2); the former agrees entirely with RV.; the  
latter deviates from it only in **d**, where it gives *turīyo ‘ham  
man-:* Ppp. combines in **b** *aparaṣ p-*. ⌊Cf. MP. i. 3. 1.⌋
