title = "३५ नमो गन्धर्वस्य"

## Translation
35. Homage to the Gandharva's mind (?), and homage to his terrible  
(*bhā́ma*) eye we pay; O Viśvāvasu, homage \[be\] to thee with worship  
(*bráhman*); go away unto thy wives, the Apsarases.

## Notes
The translation implies the naturally suggested emendation in **a** of  
*námase* to *mánase*, which Ppp. supports, reading *manaso*. Ppp. has  
further *bhāsāya* for *bhāmāya* in **b**; and, for **c**, *viśvāvaso  
namo brahmaṇā te kṛṇomi*, and, in **d**, combines *jāyā ’ps-*. The  
addition of *‘stu* at the end of our **c** would rectify the meter of  
the pāda and make the definition of the Anukr. exact.
