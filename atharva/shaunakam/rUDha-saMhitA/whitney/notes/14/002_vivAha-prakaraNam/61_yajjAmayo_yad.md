title = "६१ यज्जामयो यद्"

## Translation
61. If (*yát*) sisters (*jāmí*), if young women, have danced together  
in thy house, doing evil with wailing—from that sin etc. etc.

## Notes
Because of the redundant syllable ⌊the second *yád*, intrusion?⌋ in  
**a**, the Anukr. absurdly separates this verse from the others here,  
and calls it a *triṣṭubh*.
