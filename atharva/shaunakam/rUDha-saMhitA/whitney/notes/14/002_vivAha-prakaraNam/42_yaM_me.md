title = "४२ यं मे"

## Translation
42. What priest's portion they (dual) give to me the bride-seeker  
(*vadhūyú*), the bridal garment and bride's dress, do ye, O Brihaspati  
and Indra, assenting, together give it to the priest (*brahmán*).

## Notes
The anomalous accent *dattám* at the end is read by all our ⌊and SPP's⌋  
authorities. Ppp. varies considerably: *yan no ‘diti brahmabhāgaṁ  
vadhūyor vāso vadhvaś ca vastram;* and *dhattām* at the end.
