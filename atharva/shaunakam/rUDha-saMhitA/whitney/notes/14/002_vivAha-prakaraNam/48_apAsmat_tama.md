## Translation
48. Away from us let the darkness shine (*vas*), that is deep blue,  
brown (*piśán̄ga*), also red; she who is consuming, spotted, her I fasten  
(*ā-saj*) on this pillar.

## Notes
The latter half-verse is corrupt in Ppp. beyond intelligibility. ⌊The  
definition *sataḥpan¯kti* (cf. my note to vi. 20. 3 and *Ind. Stud.*  
viii. 45) presumably means 9 + 11: 9 + 11. If we could dispense with the  
*yā́* in **c**, the verse would be excellent so far as rhythm and cadence  
go (8 + 11: 8 + 11).⌋ It is used in Kāuś. 79. 22 in connection with  
taking away the bridal garment to cleanse it. The 'she' is perhaps the  
female demon supposed to belong to the defiled article.
