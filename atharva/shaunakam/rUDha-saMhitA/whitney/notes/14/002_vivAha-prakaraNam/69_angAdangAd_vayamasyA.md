## Translation
69. Away from every limb of her do we deposit the *yákṣma;* let that not  
attain (*pra-āp*) the earth nor the gods; let it not attain the heaven,  
the wide atmosphere; let that defilement not attain the waters, O Agni;  
let it not attain Yama and all the Fathers.

## Notes
Ppp. reads in **a, b** *yo ‘yam asyām upa yakṣmaṁ ni dhatta naḥ*. Kāuś.  
76. 14 uses the verse to accompany the purifying of the bride. The  
metrical structure (8 + 8: 11 + 11: 11 + 11 = 60) is described as well  
as the Anukr. knows how.
