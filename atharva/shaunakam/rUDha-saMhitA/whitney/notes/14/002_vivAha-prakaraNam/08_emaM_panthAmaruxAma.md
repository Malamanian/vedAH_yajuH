## Translation
8. We have mounted this road, easy, bringing welfare, on which a hero  
takes no harm, \[but\] finds others' goods.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The Āpast. text (Wint., p. 67 ⌊MP. i. 6. 11⌋) has the same verse, but  
with *sugám pánthānam ā́ ‘rukṣam áriṣṭaṁ svas-* in **a, b**. Kāuś. uses  
it in 77. 2, with 1. 64: see the note to 1. 64. ⌊For *yásmin* in **c**  
Ppp. has the sense-equivalent *yatra:* cf. its *oṣam* for our *kṣiprám*  
at xii. 1. 35; etc.⌋
