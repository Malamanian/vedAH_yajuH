## Translation
44. Clothing myself anew, fragrant, well-dressed, I have risen alive  
unto the outshining dawns; as a bird from the egg, I have been released  
out of all sin.

## Notes
Ppp. combines **a-b** *suvāso ’dā-*. According to Kāuś. 79. 27, the  
verse is used when the priest comes back after washing the bridal  
garment.
