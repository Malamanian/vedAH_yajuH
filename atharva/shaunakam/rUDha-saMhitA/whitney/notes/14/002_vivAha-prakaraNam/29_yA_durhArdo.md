title = "२९ या दुर्हार्दो"

## Translation
29. What evil-hearted young women, and likewise what old ones, \[are\]  
here—do ye all ⌊*sám*⌋ now give splendor to her; then go asunder and  
away home.

## Notes
The last pāda is nearly identical with RV. x. 85. 33 **d**: see the  
preceding note. All our mss. ⌊and SPP's⌋ read in **b** *jaratīs*, as if  
vocative; our edition ⌊not SPP's⌋ emends to *jár-*, as seems  
unavoidable.
