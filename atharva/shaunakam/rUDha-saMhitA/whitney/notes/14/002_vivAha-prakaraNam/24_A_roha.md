title = "२४ आ रोह"

## Translation
24. Mount the hide; sit by the fire; this god slays all the demons; here  
give birth to progeny for this husband; may this son of thine be of good  
primogeniture.

## Notes
The last pāda is used by Kāuś. 78. 8 as the boy is seated in the bride's  
lap, though unsuited to the purpose unless forced out of its natural  
meaning. ⌊Cf. Wint., p. 75.⌋ There must be some error in the Anukr. text  
relating to this verse and vs. 25 (which are *triṣṭubh*) and vs. 32 (see  
below).
