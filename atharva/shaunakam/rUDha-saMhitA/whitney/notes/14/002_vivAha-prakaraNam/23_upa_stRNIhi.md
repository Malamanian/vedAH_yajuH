## Translation
23. Spread under the rushes upon the red hide; sitting down upon it, of  
good progeny, let her worship this fire.

## Notes
Bp.E. ⌊and SPP's C.⌋ read at the end *saparyata*. For the use in Kāuś.,  
see the preceding note. The second half-verse is used again in 79. 5,  
when the bride sits down on the nuptial bed.
