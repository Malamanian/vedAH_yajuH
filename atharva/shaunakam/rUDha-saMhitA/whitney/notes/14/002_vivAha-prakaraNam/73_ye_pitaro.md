## Translation
73. What bride-beholding Fathers have come to this bridal-car, let them  
bestow on this bride, with her husband, protection accompanied with  
progeny.

## Notes
The *pada*-text has the bad reading *ā́: agaman*, instead of *ā॰ágaman*.  
Part of our mss. (Bp.P.M.W.O.) read in **c** *sámpatyāi*, but doubtless  
only by the scribes' oversight. According to Kāuś. 77. 12, the verse is  
to be used when the bridal train passes by a burial-place.
