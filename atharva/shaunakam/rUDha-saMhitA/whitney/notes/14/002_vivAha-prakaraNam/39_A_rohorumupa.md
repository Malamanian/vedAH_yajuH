title = "३९ आ रोहोरुमुप"

## Translation
39. Mount thou the thigh; apply the hand; embrace thy wife with  
well-willing mind; make ye (two) progeny here, enjoying; let Savitar  
make for you a long life-time.

## Notes
The first half-verse is found also in the Āpast. text (Wint., p. 90 ⌊MP.  
i. 11. 7⌋), with the variant (after *ūrúm*) *úpa barhasva bāhúm*. ⌊Ppp.,  
as just noted, makes our 37 **d** change place with our 39 **c**,  
reading, however, *rodamānāu* for *mod-*; and in its **d** it has *tu*  
for *vām*, combining *tv āyus sav-*.⌋ The verse is ill defined as a  
*jagatī* or *bhurik triṣṭubh;* it is properly a *svarāṭ triṣṭubh*.
