title = "१० ये वध्वश्चन्द्रं"

## Translation
10. What *yákṣmas* go to the bride's brilliant (*candrá*) car among the  
people, let the worshipful gods conduct those back whence they came.

## Notes
The verse is RV. x. 85. 31; RV. reads in **b** *jánād ánu*. The Āpast.  
text (Wint., p. 67 ⌊MP. i. 6. 9⌋) has the same verse. ⌊The Anukr. calls  
the vs. *yakṣmanāśanī*.⌋
