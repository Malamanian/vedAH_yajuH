title = "४३ स्योनाद्योनेरधि बध्यमानौ"

## Translation
43. Awaking out of a pleasant lair (*yóni*), mightily enjoying  
yourselves, merry, having good kine, good sons, good houses, may ye,  
living, pass the outshining dawns.

## Notes
Ppp. reads in **c, d** *subhāu suputrāu sukṛtāu carātāu jīvā uṣ-*; our  
P.M.W. have *carātho*. To accent *tárāthas*, counting it to **d**  
instead of **c**, would be an improvement. The verse (which scans 11 +  
11: 8 + 11 or 11 + 8 = 41) is very ill described by the Anukr. According  
to Kāuś. 79. 12, it accompanies the rising from the nuptial bed.
