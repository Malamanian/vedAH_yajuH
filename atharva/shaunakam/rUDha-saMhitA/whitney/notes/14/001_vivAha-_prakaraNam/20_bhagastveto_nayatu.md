title = "२० भगस्त्वेतो नयतु"

## Translation
20. Let Bhaga lead thee hence, grasping thy hand; let the Aśvins carry  
thee forth by a chariot; go to the houses, that thou mayest be  
housewife; thou, having control, shalt speak unto the council.

## Notes
RV. (x. 85. 26) begins with *pūṣā́* instead of *bhágas*. In Kāuś. (76.  
10) the verse accompanies the leading of the bride out of her house.
