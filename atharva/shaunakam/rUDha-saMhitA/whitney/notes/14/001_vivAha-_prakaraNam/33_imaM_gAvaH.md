## Translation
33. May ye, O kine, enter this man together with progeny; this man  
minisheth (*mī*) not the share of the gods; for this man shall Pūshan,  
and all the Maruts, for this man shall Dhātar, Savitar quicken (*sū*)  
you.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *viśadhvam* at end of **a**. This verse indicates distinctly  
that the preceding one is meant as a wish for prosperity in respect to  
kine.
