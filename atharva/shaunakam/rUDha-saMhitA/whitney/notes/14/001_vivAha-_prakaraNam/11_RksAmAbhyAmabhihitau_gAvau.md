## Translation
11. Haltered with verse (*ṛ́c*) and chant (*sā́man*), thy two oxen went  
peaceful (? *sāmaná*); ears were thy (two) wheels; in the sky the  
wandering track.

## Notes
*Abhíhita* seems to be the correlative to abhidhānī. Our 'ears' (p.  
*śrótre íti*) is a bad variant to RV. (x. 85. 11) *śrótram*, 'hearing.'  
RV. also has in **b** *itas* for *āitām*. We have to gain in **c** a  
syllable by harsh resolution in order to make a full pāda. Ppp. reads in  
**a** *upahitāu*.
