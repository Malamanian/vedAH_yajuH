## Translation
48. Wherewith Agni grasped the right hand of this earth, therewith grasp  
I thy hand; do not stagger in company with me, with both progeny and  
riches.

## Notes
The last pāda ⌊*prajayā* etc.⌋ is wanting in Ppp., ⌊which puts the vs.  
after 50⌋. The verse accompanies in Kāuś. 76. 19 the seizing of the  
bride's hand to lead her about the fire. The Anukr. seems to overlook  
the vs.; though, if the last pāda were omitted, it would fall under the  
general definition of the hymn, as an *anuṣṭubh*. ⌊As to vss. 48-51, cf.  
Wint., p. 48 f. For the *pāṇigrahaṇa*, he cites Rāmāyaṇa, i. 75  
(Gorresio: or i. 73 Schlegel).⌋
