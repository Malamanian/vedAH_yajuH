title = "४३ यथा सिन्धुर्नदीनां"

## Translation
43. As the ⌊mighty (? *vṛ́ṣā*)⌋ river (*síndhu*) won (? *sū*) the  
supremacy of the streams (*nadī́*), so be thou supreme (*samrā́jñī*),  
having gone away to thy husband's home.

## Notes
Perhaps *síndhu* should be rendered 'Indus' (so Zimmer, p. 317; Weber,  
p. 199). *Suṣuve*, lit. 'impelled for one's self,' is employed here in  
an unusual sen.se; the word is quoted as example under Prāt. ii. 91; iv.  
82. Ppp. reads *sūṣuve vṛkāt*. By Kāuś. 75. 27, the verse accompanies  
the emergence of the bride from the bath (with vs. 35, above).
