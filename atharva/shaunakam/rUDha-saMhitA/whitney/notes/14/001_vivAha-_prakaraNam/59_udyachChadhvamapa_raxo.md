## Translation
59. Raise ye \[your weapons\]; may ye smite away the demon; set this  
woman in what is well done; inspired Dhātar found for her a husband; let  
king Bhaga go in front, foreknowing.

## Notes
⌊Ppp. combines **a-b** thus: *hanāthe imāṁ;* and that is followed by⌋  
*nāryaṁ* ⌊for *nārīm*, as in 53, 54, 55\*⌋ in **b**. Kāuś. 76. 32 uses  
vss. 59, 60, 62 at the setting out of the bride for her new home. This  
verse also is an irregular *triṣṭubh* (11 + 10: 12 + 11 = 44). \*⌊Cf.  
the Ppp. variant *bhūmyaṁ* for *bhū́mim*, xiii. 2. 40, 41.⌋
