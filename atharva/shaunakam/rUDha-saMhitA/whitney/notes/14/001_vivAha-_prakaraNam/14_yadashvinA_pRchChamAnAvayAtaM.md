## Translation
14. When, O Aśvins, ye went asking, with your three-wheeled \[chariot\],  
to Sūryā's bridal, where was one wheel of yours? where stood ye for  
pointing out?

## Notes
The verse corresponds, without variant, to RV. x. 85. 14 **a, b** and 15  
**c, d**. The sense of the questions is wholly obscure.
