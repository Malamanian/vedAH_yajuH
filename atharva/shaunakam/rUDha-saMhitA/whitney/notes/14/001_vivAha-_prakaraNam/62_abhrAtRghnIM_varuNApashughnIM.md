title = "६२ अभ्रातृघ्नीं वरुणापशुघ्नीं"

## Translation
62. Her, not brother-slaying, O Varuṇa; not cattle-slaying, O  
Brihaspati; not husband-slaying, possessing sons, O Indra—bring \[her\]  
for us, O Savitar.

## Notes
The Āpast text (Wint., p. 41 ⌊MP. i. 1. 3⌋) has a corresponding but  
quite different verse: reading *ápatighnīm* in **b**, and, for **c, d**,  
*indrā́ ‘putraghnīṁ lakṣmyàṁ tā́m asyāi savitaḥ suva*. The Anukr. does not  
heed the deficiency of a syllable in **a**. For the use of the verse in  
Kāuś. (76. 32), see the note to vs. 59. It is wanting (as above noticed)  
in Ppp.
