## Translation
34. Free from thorns, straight, let the roads be by which \[our\]  
comrades go a-wooing for us; together with Bhaga, together with  
Aryaman—let Dhātar unite \[us\] with splendor.

## Notes
The first half-verse is RV. x. 85. 23 **a, b**, which, however, reads  
⌊with MP.⌋ *pánthās* for ⌊our metrically bad⌋ *-thānas;* the second half  
goes on: *sám aryamā́ sám bhágo no ninīyāt* etc. ⌊cf. MP. i. 1. 2⌋; our  
text is a foolish and inconsistent substitute. Kāuś. 77. 3 gives the  
verse, with 2. 11, as to be used when the bridal train starts off home;  
in 75. 12 it ⌊according to Daśa Kar., only the first half-verse⌋ is made  
to accompany the sending out of a guard for the bride. ⌊Cf. Wint., p.  
40.⌋
