## Translation
16. The two wheels of thee, O Sūryā, the priests (*brahmán*) know  
seasonably; further, the one wheel that is in secret—that, verily, the  
enlightened (*addhātí*) know.

## Notes
Is RV. x. 85. 16. All our mss. accent in **a** *sū́rye* and in **d** ⌊all  
save D.⌋ *vidúḥ;* our edition corrects both words to accordance with RV.  
Close correspondence with RV. x. 85 ceases with vs. 16, at the end of  
the Sūryā-hymn proper. ⌊SPP. reads *sū́rye* with all his authorities, and  
*vidúḥ* with nearly all. He adds: "the correction to *viduḥ* is not  
inevitable." But I do not see how the accented form is to be rendered.⌋
