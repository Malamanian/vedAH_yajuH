## Translation
57. I loosen (*vi-sā*) in me the form of her; he verily shall know,  
seeing the nest of mind; I eat not stolenly; I was freed (*ud-muc*) by  
mind, myself untying (*śrath*) the fetters of Varuṇa.

## Notes
Ppp. reads at the end *pāśam*. This verse and doubtless the next (its  
*pratīka*, which is *pra tvā muñcāmi*, would also designate vs. 19  
above) are used, with vii. 78. 1, by Vāit. 4. 11, to accompany the  
ungirding of the sacrificer's wife. Both are used also by Kāuś. 76. 28  
with the ungirding of the bride.
