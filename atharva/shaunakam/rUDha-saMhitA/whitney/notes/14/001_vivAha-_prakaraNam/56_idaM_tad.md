## Translation
56. This \[is\] that form in which the young woman (*yóṣā*) dressed  
herself; I desire to know with \[my\] mind the wife (*jāyá*) moving  
about; I will go after her with nine-fold (? *návagva*) comrades: who,  
knowing, unloosened (*vi-cṛt*) these fetters?

## Notes
This obscure verse gets no light from Ppp., the other texts, or the  
*sūtras*. The *pada*-text reads in **c** *ánu: artiṣye;* doubtless it is  
only a contraction for *ánu vartiṣye*.
