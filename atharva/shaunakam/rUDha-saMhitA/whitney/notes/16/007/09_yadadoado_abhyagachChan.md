## Translation
9. What I went at on such-and-such an occasion, what at evening, what  
in early night;—

## Notes
The translation follows our emendation, *abhyágacham;* all the mss. read  
*-chan* (one or two in *pada* perhaps *-chat*); the true sense is very  
doubtful. ⌊SPP. reads *-chan* with all his authorities: see his note,  
vol. iii., p. 352.⌋
