## Translation
9. ⌊12.⌋ Ours is etc. etc.; let him not be released from the fetter of  
the seers. Of him now etc. etc.

## Notes
All our mss. except one (D.) accent *ṛṣīṇā́m;* our text emends to  
*ṛ́ṣīṇām*. ⌊In like manner, SPP. reads *ṛ́ṣīṇām* with four or three of his  
authorities, against twelve or thirteen that have *ṛṣīṇā́m*.\]
