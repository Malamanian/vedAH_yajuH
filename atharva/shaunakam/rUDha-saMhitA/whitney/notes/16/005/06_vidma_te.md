## Translation
6. ⌊8.⌋ We know thy place of birth, O sleep; thou art son of the wives  
(*-jāmí*) of the gods, agent of Yama; ⌊9.⌋ ender art thou, death art  
thou; ⌊10.⌋ so, O sleep, do we comprehend thee here; do thou, O sleep,  
protect us from evil-dreaming.

## Notes
This verse agrees ⌊precisely⌋ with vi. 46. 2, and the ⌊words *dévānām  
patnīnāṁ garbha yámasya kara* (the readings are not quite certain)⌋  
appear in xix. 57. 3; the other verses are therefore most probably  
varied repetitions of this one.
