title = "२६ तानि कल्पद्"

## Translation
26. Shaping (?) these things, the Vedic student stood performing penance  
(*tapas tapya-*) on the back of the sea (*salilá*), in the ocean; he,  
bathed, brown, ruddy (*pin̄galá*), shines much on the earth.

## Notes
The comm. explains 25 and 26 together, as if one verse. The translation  
implies the emendation, apparently unavoidable, of *kálpat* to *kálpan;*  
the comm. makes no scruple of glossing it with *kalpayan*.  
  
⌊The quoted Anukr. says *"brahmacārī" ca*.⌋  
  
⌊Here ends the twenty-fourth *prapāṭhaka*.⌋
