## Translation
23. That, sent forth (? *pariṣūtá*) of the gods, not mounted onto, goes  
about shining; from that \[was\] born the *brā́hmana*, the chief  
*bráhman*, and all the gods, together with immortality.

## Notes
The translation of the first half-verse is merely mechanical. The second  
is identical with 5 **c, d**, above. Ppp. puts the verse after our vs.  
24, reads *puruhūtam* instead of the obscure *pariṣūtam* in **a**, and  
gives the verse a last half of its own: *tasmin sarve paśavas tatra  
yajñās tasminn annaṁ saha devatābhiḥ;* and this version of the second  
half-verse is given in GB. i. 2. 7. The comm. explains *pariṣūtam* as  
*parigṛhītam; ātmatayā sākṣātkṛtam*.
