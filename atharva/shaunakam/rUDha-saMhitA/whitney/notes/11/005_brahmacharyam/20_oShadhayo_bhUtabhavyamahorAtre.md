## Translation
20. The herbs, past and future, day and night, the forest tree, the year  
together with the seasons—they are born of the Vedic student.

## Notes
All the *saṁhitā*-mss. chance to agree in **c** in reading *sahá  
rtúbhis*, which SPP. accordingly gives in his text. Ppp. also has it;  
and further *bhūtābhavyam* in **a**, and *brahmacāriṇā* at the end.
