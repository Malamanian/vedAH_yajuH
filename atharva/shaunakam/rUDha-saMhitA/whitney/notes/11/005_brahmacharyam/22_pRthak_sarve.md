title = "२२ पृथक् सर्वे"

## Translation
22. Individually do all that are of Prajāpati bear breaths in their  
bodies (*ātmán*); all these the *bráhman* defends, brought in the Vedic  
student.

## Notes
Ppp. reads at end of **b** *bibhrate;* one would like to emend to  
*bíbhratas*. ⌊But cf. Deussen's interpretation, p. 282.⌋ Ppp. also has  
in **c** *sarvāṅs tān*.
