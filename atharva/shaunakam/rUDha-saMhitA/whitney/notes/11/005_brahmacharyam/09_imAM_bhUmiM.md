## Translation
9. This broad (*pṛthivī́*) earth, and the sky, the Vedic student first  
brought \[as\] alms (*bhikṣā́*); having made them \[both\] fuel, he  
worships; in them are set (*ā́rpita*) all beings.

## Notes
Ppp. omits the meter-disturbing *ā́* in **b**, and reads for **c**, *te  
brahma kṛtvā samidhā upāsata*. 'Worships': i.e., as the comm. explains,  
'tends the fire with them.'
