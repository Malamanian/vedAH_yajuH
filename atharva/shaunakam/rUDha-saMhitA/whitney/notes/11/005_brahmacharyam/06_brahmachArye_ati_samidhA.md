## Translation
6. The Vedic student goes kindled with fuel, clothing himself in the  
black-antelope-skin, consecrated, long-bearded; he goes at once from the  
eastern to the northern ocean, having grasped the worlds, again and  
again violently shaping (? *ācarikṛ*) \[them\].

ābhimukhyena karoti*. ⌊'Northern ocean': cf. note to xi. 2. 25.⌋
