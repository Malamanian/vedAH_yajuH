title = "१२ कुतः केशान्"

## Translation
12. Whence brought he the hair, whence the sinew, whence the bones? the  
limbs, the joints, the marrow, the flesh who brought from whence?

## Notes
Ppp. combines at the end *kutā ”bharat*. The comm. appears again to read  
*sam abharat* at end of **b**. A few mss. (including our Bp.R.) read  
*snā́vaḥ* in **a**.
