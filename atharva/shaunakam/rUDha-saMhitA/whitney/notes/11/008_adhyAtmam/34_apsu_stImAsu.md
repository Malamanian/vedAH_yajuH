title = "३४ अप्सु स्तीमासु"

## Translation
34. Within waters that are sluggish (? *stīmá*), old, is the body  
placed; within that is might (? *śáva*, *śávas*?); thence is it called  
might.

## Notes
There is perhaps in **c, d** a play upon the word *śávas*, which may  
mean either 'might' (as neut.) or (as masc.) 'corpse.' The comm.  
paraphrases it both times with balātmakaḥ sūtrātmā ⌊i.e. the  
parameśvara⌋. He explains *stīmāsu* as *anārdraṁ sarvaṁ jagad ārdraṁ  
kurvatīṣu*.  
  
⌊Here ends the fourth *anuvāka*, with 2 hymns and 61 verses. The quoted  
Anukr. says with reference to this eighth hymn *"yan manyur" ity atra  
caturdaśa ca:* that is 14 over 20.⌋
