title = "२३ विद्याश्च वा"

## Translation
23. Both knowledges and ignorances, and what else is to be taught  
(*upa-diś*); the *bráhman* entered the body; the verses, the chant, also  
the formula.

## Notes
Ppp. combines *vā ’vidyāś* in **a**, and reads for **c** *śarīraṁ sarve  
prā ’viśan* ⌊= our 25 **c**⌋. *Bráhman* perhaps is here the 'charm,'  
representing the Atharvan hymns.
