title = "३२ तस्माद् वै"

## Translation
32. Therefore, indeed, one who knows man ⌊*púruṣa*⌋ thinks "this is  
*bráhman*"; for all deities are seated in him, as cows in a cow-stall.

## Notes
Our text should read at the end *ivā́ ”sate* with SPP. and nearly all the  
mss. (our Bp.B. *ivā ”sate*). Ppp. has a less naive **d**: *śarīre ‘dhi  
samāhitaḥ*.
