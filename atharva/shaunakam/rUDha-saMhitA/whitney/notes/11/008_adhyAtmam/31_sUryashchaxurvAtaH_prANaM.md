title = "३१ सूर्यश्चक्षुर्वातः प्राणं"

## Translation
31. The sun, the wind, shared \[respectively\] the eye, the breath of  
man; then his other self the gods bestowed (*pra-yam*) on Agni.

## Notes
'Shared' (*ví bhejire*, pl.) is ungrammatical as taken with the subject  
(which is only two-fold) given in the text. The comm. understands that  
the other 'senses' with their deities are viewed as included with these  
two. Ppp. reads *tathā* instead of *atha* in **c**.
