title = "०७ येत आसीद्"

## Translation
7. The earth that was previous to this one (*itás*), which the sages  
(*addhātí*) indeed knew—whoever may know that by name, he may think  
himself knowing in ancient things.

## Notes
The translation implies emendation of *tā́n* in **c** to *tā́ṁ*, which  
SPP. gives in his text, with about half of his mss. Ppp's version is  
quite different; it reads for **a** *ye ’to bhūmiṣ pūrvā ”sit;* and, for  
**c, d**, *ke tasyan devā ”sate kasinin sā ’dhi śrutaḥ* ⌊intending  
*tasyām* and *śritā?*⌋.
