title = "२३ ये वर्मिणो"

## Translation
23. Who have defenses, who have no defenses, and the enemies who have  
defenses—all those, O Arbudi, being slain, let dogs eat on the ground.

## Notes
The accent *yé ‘varmā́ṇaḥ*, though read by all the mss. ⌊save R.⌋, is  
wholly inadmissible, and should be emended to *yè ‘v-*.
