title = "१६ वायुरमित्राणामिष्वग्राण्याञ्चतु इन्द्र"

## Translation
16. Let Vāyu bend up the arrow-points of the enemies; let Indra break  
back their arms; let them not be able to set the arrow; let Āditya make  
their missile weapon (*astrá*) disappear; let the moon put (*yu*) them  
on the track of what is not gone.

## Notes
The last clause is very doubtful and difficult; the comm. gives no aid,  
explaining with *aprāptasyā ”jigamiṣataḥ śatroḥ...panthānam  
asmatprāptyupāyabhūtam mārgaṁ yutāṁ tataḥ pṛthakkurutām* (taking *yutām*  
from *yu* 'separate,' and adding) *tādṛśam mārgaṁ śatrur na paśyatv ity  
arthaḥ*. He divides the verse into two, making the second begin with  
*ādityá eṣām*.
