## Translation
13. The thunderbolt which Brihaspati of the An̄giras race poured, an  
Asura-destroying weapon—therewith do I blot out (*ni-lip*) yon army, O  
Brihaspati; I slay the enemies with force.

## Notes
The comm. renders *ní limpāmi* by *nitarāṁ chinadmi*. He also has the  
strange reading *amūs* for *amūm* before *sénām*.
