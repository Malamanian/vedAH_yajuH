## Translation
9. The agreement (*saṁdhā*) which thou hast agreed on with Indra and  
with the *bráhman*, O Brihaspati, by that Indra-agreement do I call  
hither all the gods: conquer ye on this side, not on that!

## Notes
The comm. (with two or three of SPP's authorities) reads *-adhattās* in  
**a**; and he treats *indra-saṁdhayā* as two independent words in **c**.  
*Saṁdhā́m* in **a** is clearly proved an intrusion by the meter.
