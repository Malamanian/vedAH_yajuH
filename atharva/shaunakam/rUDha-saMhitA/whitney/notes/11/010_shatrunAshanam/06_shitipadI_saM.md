## Translation
6. Let the white-footed one tie together, this shaft (*śaravyā̀*),  
four-footed; O witchcraft, be thou for our enemies, together with the  
army of Trishandhi.

## Notes
The comm. reads for *dyatu*, in **a**, *patatu:* cf. vs. 7 **a**. By  
*śitipadī* he understands a white-footed cow, called a *śaravyà* as  
being a *śarūṇām bāṇānāṁ samūhaḥ*.
