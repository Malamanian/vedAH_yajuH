title = "२१ मूढा अमित्रा"

## Translation
21. Confounded \[be\] our enemies, O Nyarbudi; slay thou of them each  
best man (*vára*); slay \[them\] with this army.

## Notes
The comm. strangely reads *amitrān* beside *mūḍhās*. ⌊The rationale of  
his variant is perhaps as in 9. 6 above (*nnya* = *nya*). The  
*pada*-text has *amítrāḥ*. But the comm. also takes *mūḍhāḥ* as =  
*mūḍhān*.⌋
