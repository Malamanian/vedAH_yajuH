## Translation
25. Let the army of our enemies lie with thousand corpses (-*kúṇapa*) in  
the conflict of weapons, pierced through, cut to pieces (?).

## Notes
The obscure *kakajā́kṛtā* at the end is guessed by the comm. to mean  
*kutsitajananā vilolajananā vā kṛtā;* he attempts no etymology, but  
evidently sees in it the root *jā*. In **a** he has the strange reading  
*senām* for *śetām*.
