title = "२२ यश्च कवची"

## Translation
22. Whoever is mailed, and who without mail, and what enemy is in march  
(? *ájman*); by bowstring-fetters, by mail-fetters, smitten by the march  
let him lie.

## Notes
The mss. are in good part awkward about the combination *jm* (in  
*ajmani*, *ajmanā*), writing what looks like a *ṭm* or *pm*, but there  
is no real variant. The comm. explains *ájman* as *ajati gacchaty anene  
’ty ajma rathādi yānam*. He gives *abhihitas*, a preferable reading, in  
**d**.
