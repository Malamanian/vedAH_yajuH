## Translation
3. Iron-(*áyas-*)mouthed, needle-mouthed, likewise  
thorn-tree-(*vikan̄kaṭī-*)mouthed, let the flesh-eaters, of  
wind-swiftness, fasten on our enemies with the three-jointed  
(*tríṣandhi*) thunderbolt.

## Notes
The comm. regards the epithets as signifying flesh-eating birds, and  
supplies ⌊alternatively⌋ 'sent forth' (*preritās*) to the concluding  
instrumentals.
