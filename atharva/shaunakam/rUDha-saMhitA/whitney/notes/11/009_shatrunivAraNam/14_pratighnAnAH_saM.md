## Translation
14. Smiting themselves let them (f.) run together, smiting on the  
breast, the thighs (? *paṭāurá*), not anointing, with disheveled hair,  
wailing when the man is slain, bitten, O Arbudi, of thee.

## Notes
Translated by Bloomfield, ib. (see vs. 7). I follow both translators in  
rendering *paṭāurá* by 'thigh,' although it is not too acceptable,  
considering the familiarity of *ūru* as name for 'thigh.' SPP. reads  
instead *paṭūrāú*, with a very small minority of his mss. (of ours, only  
B.s.m. has it), and with the comm. The latter defines it simply as  
*tat-* (i.e. *uraḥ*) *pradeśāu*. He makes *aghārin* from *agha* and root  
*ṛ:* *aghena bhartṛviyogajanitena duḥkhenā ”rtāḥ!*
