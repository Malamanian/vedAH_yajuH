title = "१६ खडूरेऽधिचङ्क्रमां खर्विकां"

## Translation
16. Her that strides upon the *khaḍū́ra*, mutilated, wearing what is  
mutilated (?); the specters that are concealed, and what  
Gandharvas-and-Apsarases \[there are\], serpents, other-folk, demons;—

## Notes
The comm. reads at the beginning *khadūre*, and explains it as *ākāśe  
dūradeśe;* our Bp.Kp. have *ṣaḍū́re*. Again neglecting the accent, he  
takes *adhi* and *can̄kramām* as two independent words. He also reads  
*-vāśinīm* in **b**; *-vāsin* might be 'dwelling' (so understood by the  
Pet. Lexx. and Ludwig). Finally, he reckons the last (irregular) pāda to  
the following verse. ⌊Pada **e** = 10. 1 **c**.⌋
