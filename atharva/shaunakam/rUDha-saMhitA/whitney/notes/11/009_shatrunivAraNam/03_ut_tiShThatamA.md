## Translation
3. Stand ye (two) up, take ye hold; with tying up, with tying together,  
gird ye the armies of our enemies, O Arbudi.

## Notes
The dual verbs doubtless imply, as the comm. also points out, the  
inclusion of Nyarbudi in the address to Arbudi ⌊cf. vs. 11⌋. The comm.  
reads *senām* in **c**.
