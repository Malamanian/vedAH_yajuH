## Translation
25. Mastery over you have the Maruts \[gained\], the heavenly Āditya,  
Brahmaṇaspati; mastery over you have both Indra and Agni, Dhātar, Mitra,  
Prajāpati; mastery over you have the seers gained (*kṛ*)—exhibiting  
among the enemies—in case of thy bite, O Arbudi.

## Notes
One would like to emend *devás* to *devā́s* in **a**.
