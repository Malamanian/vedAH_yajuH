## Translation
2. Stand up, equip ye yourselves (*sam-nah*), O friends, god-folk;  
beheld, concealed of you be \[those\] who are our friends, O Arbudi.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The occurrence of *mitrās* m. and *mitrāṇi* n. in the same verse is  
puzzling, also the conjunction of *saṁdṛṣṭa* and *gupta*, and of *vas*  
with the singular *arbude*. The comm. reads *saṁdṛṣṭās* and *guptās* in  
**c**. Our Bp. reads *yā́ḥ* in **d**. ⌊Pāda **a** = 26 **b** and 10. 1  
**a**.⌋ ⌊W. interlines "protected?" over "concealed."⌋
