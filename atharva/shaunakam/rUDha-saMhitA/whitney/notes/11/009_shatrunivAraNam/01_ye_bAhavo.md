## Translation
1. What arms (*bāhú*) \[there are\], what arrows, and the powers  
(*vīryà*) of bows, swords (*así*), axes (*paraśú*), weapon, and what  
thought-and-design in the heart—all that, O Arbudi, do thou make our  
enemies to see; and do thou show forth specters (*udārá*).

## Notes
The comm. refers to AB. vi. 1, where Arbuda is named and called a  
serpent-sage, and declares Arbudi and Nyarbudi to be his two sons.  
*Udārān* he explains as *udgatān antarikṣacarān rakṣaḥpiśācādīn  
mantrasāmarthyodbhāvitān*, or also as *sūryaraśmiprabhavā ulkādaya  
āntarikṣyā utpātāḥ*, specters or portents. ⌊Pāda **d**, below, vs. 13  
**b**.⌋
