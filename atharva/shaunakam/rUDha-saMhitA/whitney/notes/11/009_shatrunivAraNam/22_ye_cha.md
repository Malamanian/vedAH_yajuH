## Translation
22. Both they who are wise (*dhī́ra*) and they who are unwise, those  
going away and they who are deaf, they of darkness arid they who are  
hornless (*tūpará*), likewise those that smell of (?) the goat—all  
those (m.), O Arbudi, do thou make our enemies to see, and do thou show  
forth specters.

## Notes
The meaning of *-abhivāsin* is wholly uncertain ⌊cf. Pāli *vāsita*⌋; the  
Pet. Lex. conjectures instead *-abhivāśin*, and the comm. reads  
*bastāvivāśin*, as from *basta + avi + vāśin*. He also, in defiance of  
*pada*-text and accent, renders *tamasā́s* as *támasā*. ⌊Cf. *nabhasá-s*  
(not *nábhas-as*), ix. 4. 22.⌋
