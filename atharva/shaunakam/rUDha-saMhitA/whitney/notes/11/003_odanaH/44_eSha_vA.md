## Translation
44. If thou hast eaten it with other thighs than those with which the  
ancient seers ate this, thy thighs will die: thus one says to him; it  
verily \[have\] I not \[eaten\] coming hither, nor retiring, nor coming  
on; with the thighs of Mitra-and-Varuṇa, therewith have I etc. etc.
