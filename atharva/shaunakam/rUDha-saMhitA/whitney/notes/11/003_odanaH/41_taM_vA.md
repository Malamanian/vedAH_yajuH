## Translation
41. If thou hast eaten it with another breast than that with which the  
ancient seers ate this, thou wilt not prosper with plowing: thus one  
says to him; it verily \[have\] I not \[eaten\] coming hither, nor  
retiring, nor coming on; with the earth as breast, therewith have I etc.  
etc.
