## Translation
47. If thou hast eaten it with other front-feet than those with which  
the ancient seers ate this, a serpent will slay thee: thus one says to  
him; it verily \[have\] I not \[eaten\] coming hither, nor retiring, nor  
coming on; with Savitar's front-feet, therewith have I etc. etc.

## Notes
