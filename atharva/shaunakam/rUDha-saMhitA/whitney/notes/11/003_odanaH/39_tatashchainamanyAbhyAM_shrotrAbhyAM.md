## Translation
39. If thou hast eaten it with another bulk (*vyácas*) than that with  
which the ancient seers ate this, the king-*yákshma* will slay thee:  
thus one says to him; it verily \[have\] I not \[eaten\] coming hither,  
nor retiring, nor coming on; with the atmosphere as bulk, therewith have  
I etc. etc.

## Notes
The comm. explains *vyacasā* by *vyāptimatā rūpeṇa*.
