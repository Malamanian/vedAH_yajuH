title = "०६ कब्रु फलीकरणाः"

## Translation
6. *Kábru* the hulls, the cloud the stalk (*śára*).

## Notes
The comm. reads *kabhru*, and gives a forced etymology, from *ka* 'head'  
and *bhrū* 'brow'; he also has *śíras* for *śáras*, and this reading is  
found in some of the mss. (including our B.p.m., E.s.m., O.p.m. ⌊and  
some of SPP's⌋).
