title = "१९ ओदनेन यज्ञवचः"

## Translation
19. By the rice-dish of him who hath an offering (?) all worlds are to  
be obtained together.

## Notes
The translation implies emendation of the unintelligible *yajñavacás* to  
*yajñavatas*, the Ppp. reading, as reported in the minor Pet. Lex. ⌊and  
Roth's notes⌋. The comm. explains the word as = *yajñāir agniṣṭomādibhiḥ  
prāptavyatveno ’cyamānaḥ*.
