## Translation
48. If thou hast eaten it with other hands than those with which the  
ancient seers ate this, thou wilt slay a Brahman: thus one says to him;  
it verily \[have\] I not \[eaten\] coming hither, nor retiring, nor  
coming on; with the hands of righteousness (*ṛtá*), therewith have I  
etc. etc.
