## Translation
35. If thou hast eaten it with another mouth (*múkha*) than that with  
which the ancient seers ate this, thy progeny will die from in front  
(*mukhatás*): thus one says to him; it verily \[have\] I not \[eaten\]  
coming hither, nor retiring, nor coming on; with *bráhman* as mouth,  
therewith have I etc. etc.
