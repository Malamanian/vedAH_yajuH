## Translation
33. If thou hast eaten it with other ears than those ⌊*tátas*⌋ with  
which the ancient seers ate this, thou wilt become deaf: thus one says  
to him; it verily \[have\] I not \[eaten\] coming hither, nor retiring,  
nor coming on; with heaven-and-earth as ears, with them have I eaten it,  
with them have I made it go etc. etc.
