## Translation
37. If thou hast eaten it with other teeth than those with which the  
ancient seers ate this, thy teeth will fall out (*śad*): thus one says  
to him; it verily \[have\] I not \[eaten\] coming hither, nor retiring,  
nor coming on; with the seasons as teeth, therewith have I etc. etc.

## Notes
The comm. reads *satsyanti* for *śatsyanti*.
