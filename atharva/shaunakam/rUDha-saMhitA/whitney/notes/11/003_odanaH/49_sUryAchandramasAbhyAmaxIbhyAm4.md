## Translation
49. If thou hast eaten it with another firm standing (*pratiṣṭhā́*) than  
that with which the ancient seers ate this, without firm standing,  
without support (*āyátana*) wilt thou die: thus one says to him; it  
verily \[have\] I not \[eaten\] coming hither, nor retiring, nor coming  
on; standing firm in truth, therewith have I etc. etc.

## Notes
All our *saṁhitā*-mss., and the majority of SPP's, have the false accent  
*apratiṣṭhānó ‘nāy-* in **b**; both editions emend to *-ṣṭhānò*. Some of  
our mss. (B.P.M.) read *pratiṣṭhā́yā* in **d**, as if aiming at  
*pratiṣṭháyā*.
