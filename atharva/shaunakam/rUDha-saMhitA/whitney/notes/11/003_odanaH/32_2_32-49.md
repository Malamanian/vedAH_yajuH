## Translation
32. If ⌊*ca*⌋ thou hast eaten it with another head than that (*tátas*)  
with which the ancient seers ate this, thy progeny, from the oldest  
down, will die: so one says to him; it verily I \[have\] not \[eaten\]  
coming hither (*arvā́ñc*), nor retiring, nor coming on; with Brihaspati  
\[as\] head, therewith have I eaten it, therewith have I made it go;  
this rice-dish, verily, is whole-limbed, whole-jointed, whole-bodied;  
whole-limbed, whole-jointed, whole-bodied becometh he who knoweth thus.

## Notes
The *pada*-reading of *prā́śīs* in **a** is *pra॰ā́śīḥ*.
