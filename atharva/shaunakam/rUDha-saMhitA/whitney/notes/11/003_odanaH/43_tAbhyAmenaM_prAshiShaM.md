## Translation
43. If thou hast eaten it with another bladder than that with which the  
ancient seers ate this, thou wilt die in the waters: thus one says to  
him; it verily \[have\] I not \[eaten\] coming hither, nor retiring, nor  
coming on; with the ocean as bladder, therewith have I etc. etc.
