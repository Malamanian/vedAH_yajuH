title = "२९ अग्नौ तुषाना"

## Translation
29. Strew thou the husks in the fire, in Jātavedas; wipe off far away  
the chaff (? *kambū́kān*); this we have heard to be the share of the  
house-king; also we know the portion (*bhāgadhéya*) of Perdition  
(*nírṛti*).

## Notes
Ppp. reads *upa mṛḍhvayetām* for *apa mṛḍḍhi dūram* in **b**. The comm.  
explains *kambūkān* as = *phalīkaraṇān*, and follows Kāuś. (63. 7) in  
regarding the 'wiping away' as done with the foot.
