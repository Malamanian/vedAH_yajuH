title = "३० श्राम्यतः पचतो"

## Translation
30. Know thou the toiling, cooking, soma-pressing one; make him to  
ascend the heaven-going road, by which he may ascend, arriving at the  
vigor that is beyond, to the highest firmament, to the furthest vault  
(*vyòmati*).

## Notes
'Know,' i.e. take note or be mindful of. The comm. takes the three  
participles in **a** as accus. pl. instead of gen. sing.; ⌊and reads  
accordingly *enān* at end of **b**⌋. Ppp. has, for **b**, *svargaṁ lokam  
adhi rohaye ’nam*, and omits **d**. The quotation in Kāuś. 63. 20 casts  
no light on the verse.
