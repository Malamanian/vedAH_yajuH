title = "०५ त्रेधा भागो"

## Translation
5. Threefold is set down the share that is yours of old—of gods, of  
Fathers, of mortals; know ye the portions (*áṅśa*); I share them out to  
you; that one that is the gods' shall set this woman across.

## Notes
That is (at the end), as the comm. paraphrases it, *iṣṭaphalasya pāraṁ  
gamayati* 'bring her to the further shore (the completion) of desired  
result.' Ppp. reads *jātavedas* in **a** for *yaḥ purā vaḥ*, inserts  
*uta* before *martyānām* in **b**, and has in **d** *sāi ’vaṁ* for *sa  
imām*.
