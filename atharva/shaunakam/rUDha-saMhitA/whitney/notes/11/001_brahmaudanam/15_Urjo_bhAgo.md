## Translation
15. The portion of refreshment (*ū́rj*) \[is\] set down which \[is\]  
yours of old; do thou, instructed by the seer, bring these waters; let  
this sacrifice be for you progress-gaining (*gātu-víd*), refuge-gaining,  
progeny-gaining, formidable, cattle-gaining, hero-gaining.

## Notes
'Thou' in **b** is fem., the water-bearer, doubtless, of vs. 13. The  
'yours' of **a** and the 'you' of **d** refer probably to those  
interested in the ceremony, though the comm. understands the former of  
the waters. Ppp. reads *nihatas* in **a**, combines and reads *-ṣṭā ’pā  
’harāi ’tāḥ* in **b**, puts *nāthavid* before *gātuvid* in *c*, and  
elides *vo ‘stu* in **d**.
