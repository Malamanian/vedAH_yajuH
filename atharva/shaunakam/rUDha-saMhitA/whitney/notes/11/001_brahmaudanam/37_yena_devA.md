## Translation
37. With what light the gods went up to the sky, having cooked the  
*brahmán*-rice-dish, to the world of the well-done, with that may we go  
to the world of the well-done, ascending the heaven, unto the highest  
firmament.

## Notes
The second half-verse is identical with iv. 14. 6 **c, d**, above ⌊see  
my note⌋. The comm. reads *jeṣma* in **c**, explaining it by *jayema* ⌊=  
*prāpnuyāma*⌋. Ppp. has, instead of this repetition, a new half-verse:  
*taṁ tvā pacāmi jyotiṣāṁ jyotir uttamaṁ sa nas tad dhehi sukṛtām u  
loke.*  
  
⌊The quoted Anukr. here says *saptā ’nupūrveṇa śeṣāḥ syus triṅśateḥ  
parāḥ*.⌋
