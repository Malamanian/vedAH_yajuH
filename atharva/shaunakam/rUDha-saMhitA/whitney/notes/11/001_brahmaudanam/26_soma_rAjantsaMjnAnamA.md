## Translation
26. O king Soma, strew harmony for them, for whatsoever good Brahmans  
shall sit by thee; with good call, I call loudly to the  
*brahmán*-rice-dish the seers, them of the seers, born from penance  
(*tápas*).

## Notes
In **a-b**, for *-bhyaḥ súbṛāhmaṇās*, Ppp. reads *-bhyo brāhm-*  
⌊intending perhaps *ábrāhmaṇās?* cf. vs. 32⌋; in **c** it has *ṛṣīṇām  
ṛṣayas tap-*, and *jātā* (so also the comm.) for *-tān;* ⌊and begins  
**d** with *brāhmāudane*⌋. The comm. understands *suhavā* in **d** as  
fem., and makes the sacrificer's wife the speaker. The verse is not  
quoted in Kāuś.; ⌊but Keśava cites it just before vs. 25 in 63. 3⌋.
