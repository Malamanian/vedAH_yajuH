## Translation
22. Turn thou toward her together with cattle; be opposite to her  
together with the divinities; let not curse attain thee, nor witchcraft  
(*abhicārá*); bear rule (*vi-rāj*) in thine own field (*kṣétra*), free  
from disease.

## Notes
The comm. reads *enān* in both **a** and **b**. ⌊All⌋ *pada*-mss. read  
*anamīvā́ḥ* in **d** ⌊save SPP's J. *prima manu:* W's translation and the  
comm. imply *-vā́*, and this SPP. has adopted as his *pada*-reading⌋.  
Ppp. has in **a** *prajayā sahāi ’nam*, and, for **c, d**, a very  
different (and corrupt) text: *svargo lokam abhi saṁvihīnam ādityo deva  
parame vyoma;* ⌊its **b** is corrupt⌋. According to Kāuś. 61. 42, with  
this verse the vessel is made to take a turn to the right. In **b** the  
duplication of *n̄* before *enām* is overlooked in nearly all the mss.,  
and SPP. admits in his text the ungrammatical combination.
