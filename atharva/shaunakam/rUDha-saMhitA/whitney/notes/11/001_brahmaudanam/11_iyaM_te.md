## Translation
11. This \[is\] thy thought (? *dhītí*) and this thy place of birth; let  
Aditi, of hero-sons, seize thee; cleanse away them that would fight her;  
confirm to her wealth with all heroes.

## Notes
Said, according to Kāuś. (61. 23), in connection with taking up the  
winnowing fan (*śūrpa*). The comm. explains *dhīti* as = *pāna*, taking  
it from the root *dhā* 'suck.' One would like to derive it from *dhā*  
'put,' as 'place' or something similar. Ppp. reads at the end *ni  
yachāt*.
