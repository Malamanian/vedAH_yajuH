## Translation
33. I set thee down, O rice-dish, among them of the seers; for them that  
are not of the seers there is no portion here; let Agni my guardian, and  
all the Maruts, let all the gods defend the cooked \[offering\].

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
'Is no portion for,' lit'ly 'is not also (*api*) of—a common form of  
expression in the Brāhmaṇas. Ppp. reads *rakṣanti* in **d**. The verse  
is quoted with vs. 25 **c** in Kāuś. 65. 12.
