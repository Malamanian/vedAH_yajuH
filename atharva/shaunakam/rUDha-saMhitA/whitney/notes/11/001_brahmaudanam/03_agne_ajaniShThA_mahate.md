## Translation
3. O Agni, thou hast been born unto great heroism, unto the cooking of  
the *brahmán*-rice-dish, O Jātavedas; the seven seers,  
being-makers—they have given thee birth; do thou confirm to this woman  
wealth with all heroes.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *paktaye* in **b**, combines *saptarṣ-* in **c**, and has in  
**d** *asme* and *ni yachatām*.
