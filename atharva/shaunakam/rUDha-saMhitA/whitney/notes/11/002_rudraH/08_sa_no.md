## Translation
8. Let this Bhava avoid us on every side; as fire the waters, let Bhava  
avoid us; let him not plot against us; homage be to him.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *āpāi ’vā ’gniṣ pari* in **b**, and combines *no abhi* in  
**c**. The comm. has in **c** the regular form *maṅsta;* but long *ā* in  
this tense occurs a couple of times in other texts also.
