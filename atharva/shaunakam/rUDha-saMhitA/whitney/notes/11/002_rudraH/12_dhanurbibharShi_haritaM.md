## Translation
12. Thou bearest a yellow golden bow, a thousand-slaying,  
hundred-weaponed, O tufted one; Rudra's arrow goes, a god-missile; to  
that be homage, in whichever direction from here.

## Notes
SPP. reads in **b** *sahasraghní*, with the majority of his authorities;  
none of ours have it, but P.M.W. have *-ghnyám*, with two of SPP's mss.,  
and with the comm. ⌊cf. note to x. 4. 7 and Henry's note⌋; Ppp. gives  
*-ghni*. The comm. has *śikhaṇḍi* at end of **b**.
