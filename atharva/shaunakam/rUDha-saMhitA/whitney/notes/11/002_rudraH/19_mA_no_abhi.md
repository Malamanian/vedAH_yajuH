## Translation
19. Do not let fly at us the club (? *matyà*), the god-missile; be not  
angry at us, O lord of cattle; homage to thee; elsewhere than \[over\]  
us shake out the heavenly bough.

## Notes
The bough, namely (so it would seem), from which the portents that fall  
from the sky appear to be shaken by a hostile divinity. The comm. reads  
*martyam* instead of *matyam* in **a**. He recognizes that *srās* (i.e.  
*srā\[kṣ\]s*) is from root *sṛj* ("= *vi sṛja* "). Ppp. has *srā m.  
devahitam* in **a**.
