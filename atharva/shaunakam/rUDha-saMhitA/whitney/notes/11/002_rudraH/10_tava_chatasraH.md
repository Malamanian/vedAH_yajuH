## Translation
10. Thine are the four directions, thine the heaven, thine the earth,  
thine, O formidable one, this wide atmosphere, thine is all this that  
has life (*ātmán*), that is breathing upon (*ánu*) the earth.

## Notes
Ppp. omits *tava pṛthivī*, thus rectifying the meter; and it has for  
**d** *yad ejad adhi bhūmyām*.
