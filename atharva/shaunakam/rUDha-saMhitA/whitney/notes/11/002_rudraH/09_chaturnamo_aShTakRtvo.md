## Translation
9. Four times ⌊*catús*⌋ homage, eight times, to Bhava; ten times, O lord  
of cattle, be homage to thee; thine are shared out these five creatures  
(*paśú*)—cows, horses, men, sheep and goats.

## Notes
All the mss. agree in the inconsistent readings *aṣṭakṛ́tvas* and *dáśa  
kṛ́tvas* (cf. Prāt. iv. 27); SPP. regards the comm. as having  
*daśakṛtvas* as a compound, but I do not see on what ground. Ppp. reads  
in **d** *gāvo ‘śvāṣ puruṣāṅd aj-*.
