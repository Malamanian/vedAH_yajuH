title = "२२ यस्य तक्मा"

## Translation
22. Of whom the *takmán*, the *kā́sikā*, goes as one weapon, like the  
noise of a stallion horse, to him, leading out in succession, be homage.

## Notes
The verse is very obscure, and the translation mechanical; Ppp. reads,  
in **a-b**, *eka ’śvasya*, and this reading is followed; the comm.  
supplies, to *ekam*, *apakāriṇam puruṣam*, and makes it object of *eti*  
= *prāpnoti*. Ludwig understands *nirṇayate* as 'extracting arrows from  
the quiver.' ⌊As for *vṛ́ṣaṇas*, cf. JAOS. x. 534, 524.⌋
