## Translation
3. Unto thy noise (? *kránda*), \[thy\] breath, and what pangs (?  
*rópi*) are thine, O Bhava—homage we pay to thee that art thousand-eyed,  
O Rudra, immortal one.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The comm. glosses *krandāya* with *krandanāya śabādya*, and *ropayas*  
with *ropayitryo mohayitryas tanvaḥ;* he reads at the end *amartyas*,  
explaining it as used for a dative.
