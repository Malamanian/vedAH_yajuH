## Translation
1. In the remnant \[are set\] name and form, in the remnant \[is\] set  
the world; within the remnant both Indra and Agni, everything is set  
together.

## Notes
The comm. connects the hymn with hymn 3, above, making the *ucchiṣṭa*  
the remnant of Aditi's rice-dish; he quotes Tāitt. Brah. i. 1. 9¹, where  
it says "they gave her what remained" (*uccheṣaṇa*) etc. Ppp. reads  
*rūpāṇi* for *rūpaṁ ca* in **b**.
