## Translation
4. Being fixed, fix thou, being stanch, *nyá*, the *bráhman*, the ten  
all-creators; as the wheel on all sides of the nave, the divinities  
\[are\] set (*śritá*) in the remnant.

## Notes
Ppp. gives no variant in **a**; at the end it has *devatā hitāḥ* (i.e.  
*”hitāḥ?*). SPP., against the authority of all the *pada*-mss., combines  
*dṛṅhasthiras* into one word, merely because the comm. so explains it  
(*dṛṅhaṇena sthirīkṛto lokaḥ*)—which is no reason at all for such an  
absurdity. *Nyas* the comm. glosses with *netāras tatratyāḥ prāṇinaḥ*,  
which gives us no help.
