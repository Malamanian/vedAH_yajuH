## Translation
17. Righteousness, truth, penance, kingship, toil, and virtue  
(*dhárma*) and deed (*kárman*), being (*bhūtá*), what will be, \[is\] in  
the remnant; heroism, fortune (*lakṣmī́*), strength in strength.

## Notes
Ppp. has *dīkṣā* for *rāṣṭram* in **a**: a better reading. The comm.  
explains *ṛta* here by *manasā yathārthasaṁkalpanam* 'right conception';  
*bale* at the end he makes = *balavati tasminn ucchiṣṭe*.
