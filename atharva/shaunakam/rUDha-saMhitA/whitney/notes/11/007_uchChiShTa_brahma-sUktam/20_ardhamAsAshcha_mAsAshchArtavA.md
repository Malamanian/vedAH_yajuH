title = "२० अर्धमासाश्च मासाश्चार्तवा"

## Translation
20. Both the half-months and the months, the year-divisions (*ārtavá*)  
with the seasons; in the remnant \[are\] the noisy waters, the thunder,  
the great sound (? *śrúti*).

## Notes
The comm. reads *śuci* in **d**, so we lack his conjecture as to the  
meaning of *śruti*.
