## Translation
11. The four-night \[sacrifice\], the five-night, and the six-night, of  
both kinds, together, the one of sixteen (*ṣoḍaśín*), and the  
seven-night—from the remnant were born all the sacrifices that are put  
in immortality.

## Notes
Ppp. combines *yajñā ’mṛte* near the end. The comm. understands by  
*ubhayas* in **b** the doubles of the numbers of nights given. *Ṣoḍaśin*  
is the subject of Prāt. iv. 51, and *catūrātra* (p. *catuḥ॰rātraḥ*) of  
Prāt. iv. 80.
