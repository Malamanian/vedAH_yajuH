title = "२० सर्वान् देवानिदं"

## Translation
20. The collective gods now we address, of true agreements, increasers  
of righteousness, together with their collective spouses: let them free  
us from distress.

## Notes
This verse (omitted in Ppp.) differs from the preceding only by twice  
reading *sarva* instead of *viśva*. The epithet *ṛtāvṛ́dh* may also  
signify 'increasing by righteousness.'
