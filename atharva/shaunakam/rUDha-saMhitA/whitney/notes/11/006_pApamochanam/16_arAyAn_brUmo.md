## Translation
16. The niggards we address, the demons, the serpents, the pure-folk,  
the Fathers; the hundred-and-one deaths we address: let them free us  
from distress.

## Notes
⌊With **b**, cf. viii. 8. 15, and 9. 24 below. Cf. note to iii. 1 1. 5  
for the "hundred-and-one deaths." Cf. also Chāndogya Up., viii. 7³, 9³,  
10³, where Indra passes three thirty-two-year terms of studentship with  
Prajāpati and is then bidden (viii. 11³) to pass five years more, to  
make out the full tale of 101 years.⌋
