title = "१४ यज्ञं ब्रूमो"

## Translation
14. We address the sacrifice, the sacrificer, the verses (*ṛ́c*), the  
chants (*sā́man*), the remedies; the sacred formulas (*yā́jus*), the  
invocations we address: let them free us from distress.

## Notes
*Bheṣajā*, which probably refers to material like that included in the  
Atharva-Veda, is explained by the comm. as *śāntikarāṇi vāmadevyādīni;*  
no hymns in our collection receive any such title in the Kāuśika.
