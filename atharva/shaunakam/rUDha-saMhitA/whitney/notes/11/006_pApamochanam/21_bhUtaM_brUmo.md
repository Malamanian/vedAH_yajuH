## Translation
21. Existence we address, the lord of existences, and who is controller  
of existences; all existences, assembling—let them free us from  
distress.

## Notes
*Bhūtám* at the beginning may be adjective, 'him who is.' Ppp. reads  
*patis* for *vaśī* at end of **b**, and, for **c**, *bhūtāni sarvā  
brūmas*.
