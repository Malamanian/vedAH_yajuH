## Translation
11. The seven seers now we address, the heavenly waters, Prajāpati; the  
Fathers with Yama as their chief (*śréṣṭha*) we address: let them free  
us from distress.

## Notes
Most of the mss. (including all of ours that are noted) read *saptarṣī́n*  
in **a**, and SPP. gives it in his text; the comm. has *saptaṛṣīn*.
