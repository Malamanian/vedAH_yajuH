## Translation
3. When breath with thunder roars at the herbs, they are impregnated  
(*pra-vī*), they receive embryos, then they are born many.

## Notes
Ppp. makes up the material of our vss. 3 and 4 differently, giving first  
4 **a, b** and 3 **c, d**, and then 3 **a, b** and 4 **c, d**. It reads  
*garbhaṁ* in **c**, and *vi jāyate* in **d**. The comm. paraphrases *pra  
vīyante* with *garbhaṁ gṛhṇanti* ⌊cf. xii. 4. 37⌋. ⌊For "many" one might  
better say 'in great numbers.'⌋
