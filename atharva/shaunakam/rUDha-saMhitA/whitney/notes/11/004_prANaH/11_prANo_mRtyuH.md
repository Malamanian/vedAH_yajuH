title = "११ प्राणो मृत्युः"

## Translation
11. Breath \[is\] death, breath *takmán;* breath the gods worship  
(*upa-ās*); breath may set the truth-speaker in the highest world.

## Notes
Ppp. has for **a** *prāṇo mṛtyuṣ prāṇo amṛtaṁ* ⌊cf. RV. x. 121. 2⌋,  
which is less devoid of sense; at the end it reads *lokaṁ dadhat*.
