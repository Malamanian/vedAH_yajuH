## Translation
7. Homage be to thee coming, homage be to \[thee\] going away; homage to  
thee, O breath, standing; to thee sitting also \[be\] homage.

## Notes
Compare 2. 15 above, which differs only in the vocative used. Ppp. puts  
the verse after our 8, and reads *te ‘stu* in **a**, and *namo ‘stu* in  
**b**; a few of SPP's authorities make the same combinations.
