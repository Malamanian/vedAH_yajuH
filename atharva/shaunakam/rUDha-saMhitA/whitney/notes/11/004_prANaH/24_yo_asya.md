## Translation
24. He who is lord of this that has all (*sárva*) \[kinds of\] birth, of  
all that stirs, unwearied, wise by *bráhman*—let breath go after  
(*anu-sthā*) me.

## Notes
Ppp. has at the end the easier reading *mām abhi rakṣatu*. ⌊W.  
interlines "attend" as a rendering of *anu-sthā*.⌋
