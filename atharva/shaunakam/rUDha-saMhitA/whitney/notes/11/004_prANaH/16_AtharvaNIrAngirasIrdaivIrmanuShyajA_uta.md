## Translation
16. They of the Atharvans, they of the An̄girases, they of the gods,  
also those born of men—the herbs are generated (*pra-jā*), when thou, O  
breath, quickenest.

## Notes
Ppp. has *ca yās* instead of *uta* at end of **b**, and, for **c**,  
*sarvā pra modanty oṣadhīḥ*. The adjectives are feminine, denoting the  
herbs.
