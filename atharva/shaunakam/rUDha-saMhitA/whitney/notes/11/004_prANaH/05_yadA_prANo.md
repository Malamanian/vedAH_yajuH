5. When breath hath rained with rain upon the great earth, then the  
cattle are delighted: "verily there will be greatness for us."

## Notes
⌊Cf. vs. 17 below.⌋ Ppp. has, for **a, b**: *yadā prāṇo abhyakrandīd  
varṣeṇa stanayitnunā*. ⌊Pāda **d** doubtless means precisely the same  
thing as the English slang, 'that'll be great for us!'⌋
