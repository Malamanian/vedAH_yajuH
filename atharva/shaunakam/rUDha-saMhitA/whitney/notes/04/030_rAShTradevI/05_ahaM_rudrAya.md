title = "०५ अहं रुद्राय"

+++
## Translation
5. I stretch the bow for Rudra, for his shaft to slay the  
*bráhman-*hater; I make strife (*samád*) for the people (*jána*); into  
heaven-and-earth have I entered.

## Notes
RV. (vs. 6) has no variant. The comm. foolishly regards Rudra's affair  
with Tripura as the subject of the first half-verse.
