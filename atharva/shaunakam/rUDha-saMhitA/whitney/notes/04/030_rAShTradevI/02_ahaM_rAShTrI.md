title = "०२ अहं राष्ट्री"

## Translation
2. I am queen, gatherer of good things, the first that has understood  
the matters of sacrifice; me here the gods distributed manifoldly,  
making me of many stations enter into many.

## Notes
RV. (vs. 3) differs only by reading at the end *āveśáyantīm*. The comm.  
makes *yajñíyānām* in **b** depend upon *prathamā́*, *cikitúī* being a  
separate epithet: this is, of course, equally possible.
