title = "०३ अहमेव स्वयमिदं"

## Translation
3. I my own self say this, \[which is\] enjoyable of gods and of men;  
whomsoever I desire, him I make formidable, him priest (*brahmán*), him  
seer, him very wise.

## Notes
RV. (vs. 5) has in **b** the equivalent *devébhis* and *mā́nuṣebhis*. The  
comm. absurdly explains *brahmā́ṇam* by *sraṣṭāram*, or the god Brahman.+++(5)+++
