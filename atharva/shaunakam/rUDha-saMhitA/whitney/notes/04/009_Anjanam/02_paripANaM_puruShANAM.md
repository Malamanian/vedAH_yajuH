title = "०२ परिपाणं पुरुषाणां"

## Translation
2. Protection (*paripā́ṇa*) of men (*púruṣa*), protection of kine art  
thou; in order to the protection of coursing (*árvant*) horses hast thou  
stood.

## Notes
The comm. says in **c** "of horses and of mares (*vaḍavānām*)." The  
resolution *ár-va-ta-ām* fills up **c** quite unsatisfactorily; the  
Anukr. refuses all resolution, and counts the pāda as of 6 syllables.
