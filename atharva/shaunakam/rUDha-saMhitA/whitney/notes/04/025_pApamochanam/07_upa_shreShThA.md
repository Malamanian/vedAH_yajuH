## Translation
7. The best blessings (*āśís*) have come unto us in the domain  
(*dhā́man*) of the two gods; I praise god Savitar and Vāyu: do ye free us  
from distress.

## Notes
Ppp. combines to *nā ”śiṣo* in **a**. MS. reads *āśíras* for *āśíṣas;*  
for *dhā́man* in **b** it has *dhármās*, and TS. *dhárme;* for **c**,  
both give *stāúmi vāyúṁ savitā́raṁ nāthitó johavīmi;* and, as in vs. 1,  
MS. begins **d** with *tā́*, and both end it with *ā́gasas*.  
  
The fifth *anuvāka* ends here in the middle of the *mṛgāra* group; it  
has 5 hymns and 35 verses; and the old Anukr. says *aparāḥ pañca*.
