## Translation
4. O thou of a thousand abodes (? *-dhā́man*), do thou make them lie (?)  
crestless, neckless; take back the witchcraft to him that made it, like  
a sweet-heart (*priyā́*) to a lover (*priyā́vant*).

## Notes
For *víśikhān* in **a**, Ppp. reads *viṣākhāṁ* (our P.M.W.E. have  
*víśīṣān*, our Bp.I.H.  *víśiṣān*). In **b**, SPP. reports all his  
authorities as reading *śāyayā* (p. *-ya*); no such form has been noted  
among our mss. ⌊but Ppp. has *śāyā tvam;* Benares ms. R., *chāyayā;* and  
T., *chayayā*⌋; in most mss. *y* and *p* are but imperfectly  
distinguished, and, as some of SPP's authorities are oral, he is to be  
presumed right; and the translation implies *śāyaya* ⌊for the *saṁdhi*,  
Prāt. ii. 17⌋. The comm. reads instead *kṣāyaya*, from *kṣi* (= *kṣayam  
prāpaya*). He rehearses the series of diverse senses given by Yāska to  
*dhāman*, and declares them all intended by the word in **a**. The verse  
he regards as addressed to the *sahadevī*.
