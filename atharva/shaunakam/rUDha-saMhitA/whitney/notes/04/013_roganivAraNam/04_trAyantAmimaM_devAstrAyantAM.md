title = "०४ त्रायन्तामिमं देवास्त्रायन्तां"

## Translation
4. Let the gods rescue this man, let the troops of Maruts rescue, let  
all beings rescue, that this man may be free from complaints.

## Notes
In RV., this verse and the following one change places. In **a**, RV.  
reads *ihá* for *imám*, and in **b** the sing. *trā́yatām...gaṇáḥ*. Ppp.  
ends **b** with *maruto gaṇāiḥ*, and **d** with *agado ‘sati*. The first  
pāda is defective unless we make a harsh resolution of a long *ā*. We  
had **d** above as i. 22. 2 **c**.
