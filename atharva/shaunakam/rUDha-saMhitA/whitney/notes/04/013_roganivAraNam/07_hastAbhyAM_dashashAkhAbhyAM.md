## Translation
7. With (two) ten-branched hands—the tongue \[is\] forerunner of  
voice—with (two) disease-removing hands: with them do we touch thee.

## Notes
RV. (vs. 7) has for **c, d** *anāmayitnúbhyāṁ tvā tā́bhyāṁ tvó ’pa  
spṛśāmasi*. The Anukr. takes no notice of the redundancy in our **c**.
