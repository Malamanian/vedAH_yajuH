## Translation
5. All this king Varuna beholds (*vi-cakṣ*)—what is between the two  
firmaments (*ródasī*), what beyond; numbered of him are the winkings of  
people; as a gambler the dice, \[so\] does he fix (? *ni-mi*) these  
things.

## Notes
Ppp. reads for **d** *akṣān na śvaghnī bhuvanā mamīte*, which gives a  
rather more manageable sense; our text is probably corrupt (*ví  
cinoti?*); the comm. explains *ni minoti* by *ni kṣipati;* and to the  
obscure *tāni* (not relating to anything specified in the verse) he  
supplies *pāpināṁ śikṣākarmāṇi*. He has again (as in 4 **a**) *purastāt*  
in **b**; and in **c** he understands *saṁkhyātā* (not *-tāḥ*), as  
"enumerator," and *nimiṣas* as gen. with *asya*. He also reads in **d**  
*svaghnī*, and quotes and expands Yāska's derivation of the word from  
*sva + han*. The verse is *bhurij* if we insist on reading *iva* instead  
of *’va* in **d**. ⌊Read *’va*, or *akṣā́ñ śvaghnī́va*, or with Ppp.?⌋
