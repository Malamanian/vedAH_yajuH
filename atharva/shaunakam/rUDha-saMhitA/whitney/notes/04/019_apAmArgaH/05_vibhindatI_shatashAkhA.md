## Translation
5. Splitting apart (*vi-bhid*), hundred-branched—"splitting apart" by  
name is thy father; in return (*pratyák*), do thou split apart him who  
assails us.

## Notes
Ppp. has sundry corruptions: *vivindatī* in **a**, *vibinda* in **b**,  
*taṁ tvā* at end of **c**. The comm. omits *vi* in **c**. Pāda **c**  
needs some such emendation as to *táṁ tu-ám*.
