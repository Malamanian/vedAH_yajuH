## Translation
4. When yonder, in the beginning, the gods by thee removed (*nis-kṛ*)  
the Asuras, from thence, O herb, wast thou born, an off-wiper.

## Notes
Ppp. has in **b** the older form *akṛṇvata*, and for **c** reads *tasmād  
dhi tvam oṣadhe ap-*. The comm. takes *adhi* in **c** as meaning *upari  
vartamānaḥ* or *śreṣṭhaḥ san*.
