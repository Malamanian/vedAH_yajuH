## Translation
3. Thou goest to the head (*ágra*) of the herbs, causing to shine  
(*dīp*) upon \[us\] as it were with light; also rescuer art thou of the  
simple (*pā́ka*), likewise slayer art thou of the demoniac.

## Notes
Ppp. puts *pākasya* before *trātā* in **c**; the comm. paraphrases it  
with *paktavyaprajñasya* ⌊'one whose wisdom (*prajñā*) is yet to be  
matured'⌋ *durbalasya*.
