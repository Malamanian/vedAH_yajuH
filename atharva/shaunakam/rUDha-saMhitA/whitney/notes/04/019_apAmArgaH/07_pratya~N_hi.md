## Translation
7. Since thou hast come into being reverted (*pratyáñc*), having  
reverted fruit, do thou repel (*yu*) from me all curses, \[repel\] very  
far the deadly weapon.

## Notes
The verse is nearly repeated as vii. 65. i. Ppp. has for **c, d**.  
*pratīṣkṛtyā amuṁ kṛtyākṛtaṁ jahi*. The comm. reads in **b** *-phala*,  
vocative; regarding, of course, the *apāmārga* plant as addressed.
