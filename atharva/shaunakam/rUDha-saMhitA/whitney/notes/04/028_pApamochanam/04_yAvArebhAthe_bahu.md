## Translation
4. Ye who have taken hold (*ā-rabh*) of much together in the beginning,  
if ye have let loose (*pra-sṛj*) the portent (*abhibhā́*) among the  
people (*jána*): who lord it etc. etc.

## Notes
The sense of the verse is very obscure. All the mss. without exception  
have in **b** the absurd reading *ásrāṣṭram*, which our edition emends  
to *-ṭam*, but which SPP. retains, though the comm. gives *-ṭam*. Ppp.  
has the better reading *ugrāu* for *agre* in **a**. The comm. treats  
*bahú sākám*, in spite of accents, as one word, = *janasaṁgham*.
