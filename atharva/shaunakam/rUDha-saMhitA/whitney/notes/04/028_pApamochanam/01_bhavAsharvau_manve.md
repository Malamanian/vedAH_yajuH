## Translation
1. O Bhava-and-śarva, I reverence you, know ye that; ye in whose  
direction is all that shines out (*vi-ruc*) here, who lord it over these  
bipeds \[and\] quadrupeds: do ye free us from distress.

## Notes
Ppp. has, for **b**, *yayor vāṁ yad idaṁ vitiṣṭhate;* our *vāṁ* makes  
this pāda redundant. In **c**, some of the *pada*-mss. (including our  
Bp.) have *asya* (but *asyá*, correctly, in 6 **c**). The expression in  
**b** corresponds with that in 23. 7 and vii. 25. 2. According to the  
comm., the name Bhava signifies *bhavaty asmāt sarvaṁ jagad;* and śarva,  
*śṛṇāti hinasti sarvam antakāle*.
