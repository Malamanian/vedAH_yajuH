## Translation
7. Bless us in fights, O formidable ones; visit (*sam-sṛj*) with  
\[your\] thunderbolt whoever is a *kimīdín:* I praise Bhava-and-śarva;  
\[as\] a suppliant I call loudly on \[them\]; do ye free us from  
distress.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *me* for *nas* in **a**, and leaves *-su ugrāu* uncombined.  
⌊Its closing half-verse is as in the Vulgate (as may be inferred from  
the note to vs. 2).⌋
