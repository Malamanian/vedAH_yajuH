title = "०३ यश्चर्षणिप्रो वृषभः"

## Translation
3. He who is filler of people (*carṣaṇí-*), bull, heaven-finder  
(*svarvíd*); for whom the pressing-stones proclaim \[his\] manliness;  
whose is the sacrifice with seven priests, most intoxicating—let him  
free us from distress.

## Notes
Ppp. has *carṣaṇi* instead of *vṛṣabhas* in **a**, and, for **c**,  
*yasyā ’dhvaryus saptahotā mudicyut*. The comm. renders *carṣaṇi-* by  
*manusya-*.
