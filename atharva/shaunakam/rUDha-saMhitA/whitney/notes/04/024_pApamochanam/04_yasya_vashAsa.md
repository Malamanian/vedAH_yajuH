## Translation
4. Whose are cows (*vaśā́*), bulls, oxen; for whom, the heaven-finder,  
sacrificial posts (*sváru*) are set up; for whom the bright (*śukrá*)  
\[soma\] purifies itself, adorned with sacred words (*bráhma-*)—let him  
free us from distress.

## Notes
Ppp. has in **c** *yasmiṅ śukras pravartate*. The comm. explains *vaśā*  
in **a** as "barren cow" (*vandhyā gāuḥ*), and *svaru* as  
*yūpāvatakṣaṇaśakala*, used for *yūpa*. ⌊Cf. RV. vi. 16. 47.⌋
