## Translation
7. They who mashed, who smeared, who hurled, who let loose—they \[are\]  
all made impotent; impotent is made the poison-mountain.

## Notes
That is, as the comm. is wise enough to see, the mountain from which the  
poisonous plant is brought. "Let loose" (*ava-sṛj*) probably applies to  
arrows as distinguished from spears; though "hurl" might be used equally  
of both. Ppp. has in **c** *santu* instead of *kṛtās*. According to  
SPP., the text used by the comm. combines *ye ‘pīṣan;* *apīṣan* is an  
anomalous form for *apiṅṣan*, with which the comm. glosses it.
