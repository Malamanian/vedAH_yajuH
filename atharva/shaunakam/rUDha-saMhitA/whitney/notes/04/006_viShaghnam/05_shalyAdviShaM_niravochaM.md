## Translation
5. From the tip have I exorcised the poison, from the anointing and from  
the feather-socket; from the barb (*apāṣṭhá*), the horn, the neck have I  
exorcised the poison.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *vocam* instead of *avocam* in **a** and **d**, and its **b**  
is *āñjanāt parṇadher uta*. Prāt. ii. 95 regards *apāṣṭha* as from  
*apa-sthā*, doubtless correctly; between the "barb" and the "horn" there  
is probably no important difference. To the comm., the *apāṣṭha* is a  
poison-receptacle (*apakṛṣṭāvasthād etatsaṁjñād viṣopādānāt*).
