## Translation
8. They who make offering from the intermediate directions of the  
quarters, O Jātavedas, \[who\] from all the quarters vex us—having come  
upon the *bráhman*, let them etc. etc.

## Notes
Several of our mss. accent *digbhyó ‘bhidā́s-*. The other texts have  
nothing that corresponds to this verse.  
  
This, the eighth and concluding *anuvāka* of the book, has 5 hymns and  
47 verses; the quotation from the old Anukr. is *saptadaśā ’ntyaḥ*, to  
which is added *ṣaḍarcavac ca*.  
  
Here ends also the ninth *prapāṭhaka*.  
  
One of our mss. (I.) sums up the content of the book as 323 verses; the  
true number is 324. ⌊Observe that the last vs. of hymn 20 is numbered 7  
when it should be 9.⌋
