## Translation
6. They who make offering from the atmosphere, O Jātavedas, \[who\] from  
the midway (*vyadhvá*) quarter vex us—having come upon Vāyu, let them  
etc. etc.

## Notes
The comm. understands *vyadhva* as "trackless" (*vigatā adhvāno  
yasyām*). The other texts take no notice of such a quarter.
