## Translation
8. That is the middle of the draft-ox, where this carrying (*váha*) is  
set; so much of him is in front (*prācī́na*) as he is put all together on  
the opposite side.

## Notes
The virtual meaning of the second half-verse appears plainly to be that  
the two parts of the ox, before and behind the point where the pull  
comes (i.e. where the yoke rests) are equal; but it is strangely  
expressed, and the reason why the point is insisted on does not appear.  
The comm. so understands it: *evam prākpratyagbhāgāv ubhāv api samānāu;*  
he renders *vaha* this time by *bhāra;* Ludwig takes it as "the hump."  
⌊In *this* verse, **b** can hardly mean "where the pull comes," but  
rather 'where the burden is put,' i.e. the back; cf. Deussen, l.c., p.  
231. Nevertheless, see BR. under *vaha*, 2 a and 2 b.⌋
