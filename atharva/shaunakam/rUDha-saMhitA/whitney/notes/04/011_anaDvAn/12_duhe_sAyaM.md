title = "१२ दुहे सायं"

## Translation
12. He milks (*duh*) at evening, he milks in the morning, he milks about  
midday; the milkings of him that come together, those unfailing ones we  
know.

## Notes
Ppp. has for **a, b** *duhe vā ’naḍvān sāyaṁ duhe prātar duke divā*, and  
at the end (as above noted) *anapadasyatas*. The comm. supplies to  
*duhe* either *anaḍvāham* as object (with the worshiper as subject), or  
*anaḍvān* as subject (with the performer of the *sava* sacrifice as  
beneficiary); *saṁ yanti* he explains by *phalena saṁgacchante*.
