## Translation
2. The draft-ox \[is\] Indra; he looks out from (for?) the cattle;  
triple ways the mighty one (*śakrá*) measures out (traverses?); yielding  
(*duh*) the past (? *bhūtá*), the future, existing things (*bhúvana*),  
he goes upon (*car*) all the courses (*vratá*) of the gods.

## Notes
Ppp. reads in **a** *indrasya* for *indraḥ sa*, and in **c** it adds  
*sam* before *bhūtam*, and has *bhuvanaṁ* instead of *-nā*. The comm.  
has in **b** the curious reading *stiyān* for *trayā́n*, and hence we  
lose his guess as to what may be meant by the "triple ways." He takes  
*paśubhyas* in **a** first as dative, and then as ablative. He  
understands *bhúvanā* as virtually "present"; more probably it has its  
usual sense of 'existences,' and the two preceding adjectives qualify it  
distributively, or are in apposition with it: "all existing things,  
both what is and what is to be." ⌊If we pronounce again *naḍvā́n*, the  
vs. loses its *bhurij* quality. The cadence of **b** is bad.⌋
