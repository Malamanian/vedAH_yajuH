## Translation
7. If, falling into a pit, he hath been crushed (*sam-śṛ*), or if a  
stone hurled (*pra-kṛ*) hath smitten \[him\]—as a Ṛbhu the parts of a  
chariot, may it put together joint with joint.

## Notes
A number of the mss. (including our P.M.O.Op.) read *kártum* for  
*kartám* in **a**; the comm. explains *kartam* as meaning *kartakaṁ  
chedakam āyudham*, and makes it subject of *saṁśaśré* = *saṁhinasti;* he  
takes *ṛbhus* as one of the three Ṛbhus (quoting RV. i. 111. 1), not  
giving the word any general sense. Ppp. again has an independent text:  
*yadi vajro visṛṣṭā sthārakā jātu patitrā yadi vā ca riṣṭam: vṛkṣād vā  
yadi vā vibhyasi śīrṣa rbhūr iti sa evaṁ saṁ dhāmi te paruḥ*. The verse  
is a *bṛhatī* only by number of syllables (10 + 10: 8 + 8 = 36). ⌊The  
comm. makes the "Atharvanic spell" the subject in **d**.⌋
