## Translation
4. Waters from the ocean to the sky they carry up, they who pour  
\[them\] from the sky upon the earth—the Maruts who go about lording it  
with the waters: let them free us from distress.

## Notes
The absence of accent of *vahanti* forbids us to make the better  
construction of it with *yé*—which, however, the comm. does not scruple  
to adopt.
