title = "०१ मरुतां मन्वे"

## Translation
1. The Maruts I reverence; let them bless me; let them favor this steed  
(? *vā́ja*) in the race (? *vā́jasāta*); I have called on them for aid,  
like easily-controlled swift \[horses\]: let them free us from distress.

## Notes
Ppp. combines *-sāta ’vantu* at end of **b**. Some of our mss.  
(P.M.W.E.O.) read *sūyámān* in **c**. The comm. has *aṅśūn* instead of  
*āśūn* in **c**, and explains it as either "reins" or "horses." *Vā́ja*  
and *vā́jasāta* he makes either "food" and the "winning of food," or  
"strength " and "combat." The version of the other texts is quite  
different; they have *nas* for *me* in **a**; for **b**, *pré ’mā́ṁ vā́caṁ  
víśvām avantu víśve;* for **c**, *āśū́n huve suyámān ūtáye;* and at the  
end *énasas*.
