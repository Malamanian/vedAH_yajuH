## Translation
5. They who gratify with sweet drink, who with ghee; or who combine  
(*sam-sṛj*) vigor (*váyas*) with fatness; the Maruts who, lording it  
with the waters, cause to rain: let them free us from distress.

## Notes
Ppp. reads in **a** (as in 26. 6 a) *kīlālāis;* and it rectifies the  
meter of **c** by omitting  *adbhis*. The comm. takes *váyas* first as  
"bird" (*pakṣijātam*), then as *śarīrapariṇāmaviśeṣas*.
