## Translation
2. Who always open (*vi-ac*) an unexhausted fountain; who pour in sap  
into the herbs—I put forward the Maruts, sons of the spotted one: let  
them free us from distress.

## Notes
With **a** compare xviii. 4. 36. Some of our mss. (P.M.W.I.O.) read in  
**c** *-mātṝs*. The comm. explains *útsam* by *megham*, *vyacanti* by  
*antarikṣe vistārayanti*, and *pṛśni* as the *mādhyamikā vāk*.
