title = "०६ पवस्तैस्त्वा पर्यक्रीणन्"

## Translation
6. For covers (? *pavásta*) they bought thee, also for garments (?  
*dūrśá*), for goat-skins; purchasable (? *prakrī́*) art thou, O herb;  
spade-dug one, thou rackest not.

## Notes
The comm. knows nothing of what *pavasta* and *dūrśa* mean, but  
etymologizes the former out of *pavana* and *asta* (*pavanāyā ’stāiḥ  
sammārjanītṛṇāiḥ*), and the other out of *dus* and *ṛśya*  
(*duṣṭaṛśyasambandhibhiḥ*)! *Prakrīs* he renders by *prakarṣeṇa krītā*.
