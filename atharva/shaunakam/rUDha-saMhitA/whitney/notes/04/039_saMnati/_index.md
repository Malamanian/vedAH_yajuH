## Comment
This prose-hymn (the two concluding verses metrical) is, as already noted, wanting in Pāipp. A similar passage is found in TS. (vii. 5. 23). The hymn is used by Kāuś. in the parvan sacrifices (5. 8) with the saṁnati offerings, and vss. 9 and 10 earlier in the same ceremonies with two so-called purastāddhomas (3. 16); also the hymn again in the rites (59. 16) for satisfaction of desires. Verse 9 appears in Vāit. (8. 11) in the cāturmāsya rites, with an offering by the adhvaryu. *⌊The Anukr. gives Brahman as the ṛṣi of 9 and 10.⌋
