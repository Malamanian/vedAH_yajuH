## Translation
7. In the quarters they paid reverence to the moon (*candrá*); it  
throve; as in the quarters they paid reverence to the moon, so let the  
reverencers pay reverence to me.

## Notes
In TS., the asterisms (*nákṣatra*) are here connected with the moon; and  
there follow similar passages respecting Varuṇa with the waters, and  
several other divinities.
