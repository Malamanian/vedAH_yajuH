## Translation
8. The quarters are milch-cows; of them the moon is calf; let them, with  
the moon as calf, milk for me etc. etc.

## Notes
Both editions read *duhām* in this verse, as in vss. 2, 4, 6, following  
the authority of nearly all the mss.; only our H.D. have the true  
reading, *duhrām*, which ought to have been adopted in our text.
