## Translation
1. I reverence you, O heaven-and-earth, ye well-nourishing ones  
(*subhójas*), who, like-minded (*sácetas*) did spread out unmeasured  
intervals (*yójana*); since ye became foundations (*pratiṣṭhā́*) of good  
things, do ye free us from distress.

## Notes
Ppp. omits the intrusive and meter-disturbing *sácetasāu* (which, on  
account of its accent, is reckoned to **b** in the translation, as it  
is also by the *pada*-text); and, against rule, it combines in **b** *ye  
‘prath-*. The comm., with one of SPP's mss., reads *aprathetām;* and  
TS.MS. have the same, followed by *ámitebhir ójobhir yé pratiṣṭhé  
ábhavatāṁ vásūnām:* they have of the verse only these two pādas, used as  
part of a closing verse. The first half-verse is found also in the  
Nāigeya-*kāṇḍa* of SV. (i. 623 **a, b**): this reads *mánye* for  
*manvé*, accents *subhójasāu*, omits (like Ppp.) *sácetasāu*, and ends  
with *ámitam abhi yójanam;* its second half-verse is our 2 **c, d**.
