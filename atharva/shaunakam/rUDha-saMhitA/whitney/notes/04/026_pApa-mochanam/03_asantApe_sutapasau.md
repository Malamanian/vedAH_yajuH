title = "०३ असन्तापे सुतपसौ"

## Translation
3. I call upon the not-distressing, of excellent penance, wide,  
profound, to be reverenced by poets: O heaven- etc. etc.

## Notes
Possibly an antithesis is intended between the first two (doubtfully  
translated) epithets, both founded on *tap* 'heat.' Ppp. has the better  
reading *vām* for *aham* at end of **a**.
