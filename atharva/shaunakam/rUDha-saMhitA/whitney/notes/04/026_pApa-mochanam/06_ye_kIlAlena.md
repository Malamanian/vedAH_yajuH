## Translation
6. Ye who gratify with sweet drink (*kīlā́la*), who with ghee; without  
whom \[men\] can \[do\] nothing whatever: O heaven- etc. etc.

## Notes
All the *pada*-mss. make in **b** the absurd division *śaknu॰vánti*, as  
if the word were a neut. pl. from the stem *śaknuvánt*. Ppp. has in  
**a** *kīlālāis*. The comm. interprets *kīlāla* simply as *anna*.
