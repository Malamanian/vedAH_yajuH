## Translation
5. Whose \[are\] all the snowy mountains by \[his\] greatness; whose,  
verily, they call Rasā in the ocean; and of whom these directions are  
the (two) arms—to what god may we pay worship with oblation?

## Notes
The comm. extends his construction of vs. 4 through **a, b** here, and  
is perhaps right in so doing; the translation assimilates them to **c**.  
The verse corresponds to RV. 4 (with which VS. xxv. 12 precisely  
agrees); in **a**, RV.VS.TS. have *imé* for *víśve*, and MS. *imé víśve  
giráyo m-;* for **b**, all of them read *yásya samudráṁ rasáyā sahā́  
”hús* (save that MS. puts *yásya* after *samudráṁ;* and Ppp. has the  
same **b** as MS.); in **c**, RV.VS.TS. begin *yásye ’mā́ḥ pr-*, while  
MS., with Ppp., reads *díśo yásya pradíśaḥ* (Ppp. -*śaṣ*) *páñca devī́ḥ*.  
The "ocean" is of course the atmospheric one; and Rasā, the heavenly  
river, can hardly help having been originally the Milky Way; but the  
comm. takes it here as simply a river, representative of rivers in  
general. Pādas **b** and **c** are irregular, being defective unless we  
make harsh and difficult resolutions.
