## Translation
6. The waters in the beginning favored (*av*) the all, assuming an  
embryo, they the immortal, order-knowing ones, over whom, divine ones,  
the god was—to what god may we pay worship with oblation?

## Notes
Here **a, b** correspond to RV. 7 **a, b**, and **c** to RV. 8 **c**,  
all with important variants, which are in part unintelligent  
corruptions: RV. reads *ā́po ha yád bṛhatī́r viśvam ā́yan g- d- janáyantīr  
agním;* and *yó devéṣv ádhi devá éka ā́sīt;* VS. (xxvii. 25 **a, b**, 26  
**c**) agrees throughout; TS. has *mahatī́r* in **a**, and *dákṣam* (for  
*gárbham*) in **b**; MS. also has *mahatī́r*, and it lacks **c**. Ppp.  
has a text all its own: *āpo ha yasya viśvam āyur dadhānā garbhaṁ  
jaitayanta mātarā: tatra devānām adhi deva āstha ekasthūne vimate dṛḍhe  
ugre*. And TA. (i. 23. 8), with an entirely different second half,  
nearly agrees in **a, b** with RV., but has *gárbham* for *víśvam*,\*  
and *svayambhúm* for *agním*. All the mss. (except, doubtless by  
accident, our I.) give in **c** *āsīt*, which SPP. accordingly adopts in  
his text; ours makes the necessary emendation to *ā́sīt*. The comm. reads  
in **c** *deveṣu*, as a Vedic irregularity for -*vīṣu;* he renders  
*āvan* in **a** by *arakṣan* or *upacītam akurvan;* perhaps we should  
emend to *ā́ vran* 'covered.' \*⌊Further, TA. has *dákṣam* for *gárbham*  
of RV.⌋
