title = "०६ येन देवा"

## Translation
6. By whom the gods discovered the immortal; by whom they made the herbs  
rich in honey; by whom the gods brought the heaven (*svàr*)—let him free  
us from distress.

## Notes
The comm. takes *amṛta* in **a** as meaning the drink of immortality;  
more probably it signifies immortality itself.
