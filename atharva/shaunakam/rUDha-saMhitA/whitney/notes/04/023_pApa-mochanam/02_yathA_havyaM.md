## Translation
2. As thou carriest the oblation, O Jātavedas; as, foreknowing, thou  
adaptest the sacrifice—so do thou convey to us favor from the gods: let  
him free us from distress.

## Notes
Ppp. offers no variants in vss. 2-4, but puts 4 next after 1. The comm.  
takes *devebhyas* in **c** first as dative and then as ablative.
