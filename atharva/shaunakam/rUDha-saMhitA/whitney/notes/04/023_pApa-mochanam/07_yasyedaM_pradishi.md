## Translation
7. In whose direction \[is\] whatever shines forth (*vi-ruc*) here, what  
is born and to be born, all of it—I praise Agni, \[as a\] suppliant I  
call loudly on \[him\]—let him free us from distress.

## Notes
TS. and MS. have a quite different first half-verse: *yásye ’dám prāṇán  
nimiṣád yád éjati yásya jātáṁ jánamānaṁ ca kévalam*. The comm. renders  
*nāthitas* first by *nāthamānaḥ, phalaṁ kāmayamānaḥ*, and then by  
*nāthaḥ svāmī saṁjāto ‘sya*.
