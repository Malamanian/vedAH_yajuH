## Translation
5. With whom as ally the seers made \[their\] strength shine out; with  
whom they repelled the wiles of the Asuras; with whom, Agni, Indra  
conquered the Paṇis—let him free us from distress.

## Notes
Ppp. makes in **a** the combination *yena rṣ-*, and reads in **b**  
*idyotayan;* for the latter, the comm. (with two or three of SPP's mss.)  
gives *uddyotayan;* a few of the mss. (including our Bp.K.) have  
*-tayam*.
