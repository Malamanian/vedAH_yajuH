## Translation
4. That out of which were fashioned the thirty-spoked months; out of  
which was fashioned the twelve-spoked year; that which circling  
days-and-nights did not attain—by that rice-mess let me overpass death.

## Notes
SPP. gives in **c** the *pada*-reading *ahorātrā́ḥ*, as required by the  
participle *pariyántas;* all the *pada*-mss. have *-trā́;* the comm. has  
*paryantas*, but explains it as *paryāvartamānās*, and says nothing  
about the abnormal form. The verse (11 + 13: 11 + 11 = 46) is in no  
respect a *jagatī;* the ejection of *yásmāt* in **b** would make it  
regular.
