## Translation
2. That by which the being-makers overpassed death; which they  
discovered by fervor, by toil (*śráma*); which the *bráhman* of old  
cooked for Brahmán—by that rice-mess let me overpass death.

## Notes
The comm. explains *bhūtakṛ́tas* as *prāṇināṁ kartāro devāḥ*, but  
*ṛṣayas* is always the noun used with it.
