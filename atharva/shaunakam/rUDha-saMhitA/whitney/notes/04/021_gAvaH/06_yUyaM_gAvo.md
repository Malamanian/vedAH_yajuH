title = "०६ यूयं गावो"

## Translation
6. Ye, O kine, fatten whoever is lean; the unlovely (*aśrīrá*) one ye  
make of good aspect; ye make the house excellent, O ye of excellent  
voice; great is your vigor (*váyas*) called in the assemblies (*sabhā́*).

## Notes
The RV. version agrees at all points with ours; TB. accents *kṛ́śam* in  
**a** and has *aślīlā́m* in **b** (its *kṛṇuthāt* is a misprint, as its  
commentary shows). The comm. reads *kṛṇuta* in **c**; *sabhāsu* in **d**  
he paraphrases with *janasamūheṣu*.
