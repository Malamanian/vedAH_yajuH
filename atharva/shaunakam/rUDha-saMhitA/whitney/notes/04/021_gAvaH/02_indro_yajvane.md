## Translation
2. To the sacrificer and singer, to the helpful one (?), Indra verily  
gives further, steals not what is his; increasing more and more the  
wealth of him, he sets the godly man (*devayú*) in an undivided domain  
(? *khilyá*).

## Notes
The other texts have in **a** the decidedly better reading *pṛṇaté ca  
śikṣati* of which ours is simply a corruption; the comm., heedless of  
the accent, takes our *śíkṣate* as a verb (= *gāḥ prayacchati*). In  
**d** they have the better accent *ábhinne;* and TB. reads *khillé;*  
most of our mss. could be better understood as *khilpé* than as  
*khilyé;* the comm. defines *khila* as *aprahataṁ sthānam*, and *khilya*  
as *tatrabhava;* R. conjectures "stonewall" for *khilya*. All our mss.,  
and part of SPP's, read *mukhāyati* in **b**.
