title = "०३ दिव्यस्य सुपर्णस्य"

## Translation
3. Of that heavenly eagle art thou the eye-pupil; thou here hast  
ascended the earth as a wearied bride (*vadhū́*) a litter.

## Notes
Ppp. puts *divyasya* after *suparṇasya*. The ground of the comparisons  
made in the verse is altogether obscure, and the comm. casts no light  
upon them. ⌊Bloomfield discusses this vs., AJP. xvii. 402.⌋
