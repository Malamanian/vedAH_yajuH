## Translation
6. Born together with efficacy (? *ā́bhūti*), O missile (*sā́yaka*)  
thunderbolt, thou bearest superior power, O associate; be thou allied  
(*medín*) with our energy (*krátu*), O fury, much-invoked one, in the  
mingling (*saṁsṛ́j*) of great riches.

## Notes
RV. has in **b** *abhibhūte* instead of the difficult *sahabhūte;* and  
Ppp. (*ebhibhūta utt-*) supports RV. The comm. explains *kratvā* in  
**c** by *karmaṇā*. One is tempted to emend in **a** (also in 32. 1  
**a**) to *vajrasāyaka* 'whose missile is the thunderbolt.'
