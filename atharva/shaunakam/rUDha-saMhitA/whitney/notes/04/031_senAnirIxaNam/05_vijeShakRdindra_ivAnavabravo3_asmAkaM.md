title = "०५ विजेषकृदिन्द्र इवानवब्रवो३ऽस्माकं"

## Translation
5. Victory-making, like Indra, not to be talked down, do thou, O fury,  
be our over-lord here; thy dear name we sing, O powerful one; we know  
that fount whence thou camest (*ā-bhū*).

## Notes
The comm. explains *anavabravá* as "speaking things—i.e. means of  
victory—that are not new (*a-nava*)." The verses 5-7 are not full  
*jagatīs*.
