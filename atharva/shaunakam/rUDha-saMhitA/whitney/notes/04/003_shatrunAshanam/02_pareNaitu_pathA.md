## Translation
2. By a distant (*pára*) road let the wolf go, by a most distant also  
the thief; by a distant one the toothed rope, by a distant one let the  
malignant hasten (*ṛṣ*).

## Notes
The latter half-verse is found again as xix. 47. 8 **a, b**. Ppp's  
version is *parameṇa pathā vṛkaḥ pareṇa steno rarṣatu: tato vyāghraṣ  
paramā*. The comm. naturally explains the "toothed rope" as a serpent;  
*arṣatu* he simply glosses with *gacchatu*.
