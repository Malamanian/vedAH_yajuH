## Translation
5. What thief shall come today, he shall go away smashed; let him  go  
by the falling-off (*apadhvaṅsá*) of roads; let Indra smite him with the  
thunderbolt.

## Notes
The first half-verse is identical with xix. 49. 9 **a**, 10 **d**. The  
comm. separates *apa* from *dhvaṅsena*, and construes it with *etu;*  
*dhvaṅsa* he renders "bad road" (*kaṣṭena mārgeṇa*).
