## Translation
3. Attack, O fury, being mightier than a mighty one; with fervor as ally  
smite apart the foes; slayer of enemies, slayer of Vṛtra, and slayer of  
barbarians, do thou bring to us all \[their\] good things.

## Notes
Ppp. rectifies the meter of **b** (the Anukr. does not notice its  
deficiency) by inserting *iha* before *śátrūn*.  
  
⌊See above, p. lxxiv.⌋
