## Translation
7. Go thou forth against \[them\]; be on our right hand; then will we  
(two) smite and slay many Vṛtras; I offer to thee the sustaining top of  
the sweet (*mádhu*); let us both drink first the initial draught (?  
*upāṅśú*).

## Notes
Ppp. has at the end *pibeva*. RV. has *me* instead of *nas* at end of  
**a**, and combines *ubhā́ up-* in **d**. The comm. begins **b** with  
*atha*. Compare also RV. viii. 100 (89). 2, of which the present verse  
seems a variation; its **a**, *dádhāmi te mádhuno bhakṣám ágre*, is much  
more intelligible than our corresponding **c**. ⌊In **b**, is not  
*vṛtrā́ṇi* (neuter!) rather 'adversaries,' as in v. 6. 4?—In his prior  
draft, W. renders, "let us both drink first in silence (?)." "Initial  
draught" seems to overlook the gender of *upāṅśú.*⌋
