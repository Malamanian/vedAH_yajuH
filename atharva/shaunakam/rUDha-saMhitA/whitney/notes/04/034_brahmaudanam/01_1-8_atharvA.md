## Translation
1. The *bráhman* \[is\] its head, the *bṛhát* its back, the *vāmadevyá*  
the belly of the rice-mess; the meters \[are\] the (two) sides  
(wings?), truth its mouth; the *viṣṭārín* \[is\] a sacrifice born out  
of fervor (*tápas*).

## Notes
Ppp. reads *śiras* in **a**, and its **d** is *viṣṭā yajñas tapaso ‘dhi  
jātaḥ*. The comm. explains *brahman* as signifying here the *rathantara  
sāman*, and also *satyam* in **c** as "the *sāman* so called; or else  
the highest *brahman";* *viṣṭārín* he makes to mean  
*vistīryamāṇāvayava*.
