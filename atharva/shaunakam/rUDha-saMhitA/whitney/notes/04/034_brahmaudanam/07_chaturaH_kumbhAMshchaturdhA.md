## Translation
7. Four vessels (*kumbhá*), four-fold, I give, filled with milk, with  
water, with curds—let all these etc. etc.

## Notes
Ppp. had the first two pādas, as noted above, in its vs. 5, reading for  
**a** *catuṣkumbhyāṁ caturdhā dadāti;* its vs. 7 is our 5 **c, d** (with  
the variants already given) together with the last two pādas of the  
refrain, reading *svadhayā* for *madhumat* in the former pāda, and *mā*  
for *tvā* in the latter. The comm. (with one or two of SPP's mss. that  
follow him) has *dadhāmi* in **a**.
