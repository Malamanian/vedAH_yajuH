## Translation
7. Whose chariot, of true track, of straight reins, goes spoiling  
against him who behaves (*car*) falsely—I praise Mitra-and-Varuṇa;  
\[as\] a suppliant I call loudly on \[them\]: do ye free us from  
distress.

## Notes
TS.MS. have *yó vāṁ rátha ṛjúraśmiḥ satyádharmā míthiś cárantam* (MS.  
*mithucár-*) *upayā́ti dūṣáyan;* then TS. reads *-ruṇā* in **c**, and MS.  
*tā́* at beginning of **d**; and both end (as in vs. 1) with *ā́gasas.*  
  
⌊Here end the Mṛgāra hymns.⌋
