## Translation
6. Ye who favor Medhātithi, who Triśoka, who Uśanas Kāvya, O  
Mitra-and-Varuṇa; who favor Gotama, also Mudgala—do ye free us from  
distress.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *uśanam* in **b**, and its **c** is *yāu mudgalam avatho  
gāutamaṁ ca* (our O.Op. also have *gāútamam* ⌊comm. to Prāt. iv. 16  
cites it as *gótama*⌋).
