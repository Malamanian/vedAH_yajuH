## Translation
2. Ye who, accordant, thrust \[away\] the malicious; \[who\] favor the  
truthful one in conflicts; who, men-watching, go unto the brown soma—do  
ye free us from distress.

## Notes
The translation implies emendation in **c** of *babhrúṇā* (our P.M. have  
*babhrū́ṇā*\*) to *babhrúm ā́;* the comm. understands "with your brown  
chariot"; Ludwig takes the word as proper name: "pressed by Babhru."  
Ppp. has for **a** *satyojasāu dṛhvaṇī yo niredhe* ⌊cf. its version of 1  
**b**⌋, and again *haveṣu* for *bhareṣu*. The comm. (with one or two  
mss., including our Op.) reads *gacchatas* in **c**. \*⌊And W. has  
*babhrūṇā*.\]
