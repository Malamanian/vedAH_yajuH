title = "०९ भीमा इन्द्रस्य"

## Translation
9. Terrible are Indra's missiles, a hundred spears of gold; with them  
let him push out the oblation-eating, *ávakā*-eating Gandharvas.

## Notes
This very slightly varied repetition of vs. 8 is wanting in Ppp. All the  
mss. have *ṛṣatu* at the end here.
