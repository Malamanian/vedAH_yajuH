## Translation
4. For he of the heaven, he of the earth the right-stander, fixed  
(*skabh*) \[as his\] abode (*kṣéma*) the (two) great firmaments  
(*ródasī*) the great one, when born, fixed apart the (two) great ones,  
the heaven \[as\] seat (*sádman*) and the earthly space (*rájas*).

## Notes
Ppp., after our vs. 3, makes a verse out of our 4 **c, d** and 5 **a,  
b**; and then, after our vs. 6, another verse out of our 4 **a, b** and  
5 **c, d**; and TS. (ii. 3. 14⁶) and AśS. (iv. 6. 3) combine our 4 **c,  
d** and 5 **a, b** in the same way (omitting the rest), while AB. (i.  
19. 3) virtually supports them, by giving our **c** as a pratīka. All  
the three read in **c** *astabhāyat* (TS. without accent), and AśS.  
intrudes *pitā* after *dyām* in **d**. In our text we ought to have not  
only (with TS.) *askabhāyat* in **c**, but also *āsk-* in **b**; the  
accents seem to have been exchanged by a blunder. The comm. makes the  
sun the "he" of **a**; he renders *kṣémam* in **b** by *avināśo yathā  
bhavati;* and *ví* in **c** apparently by *vyāpya vartamānaḥ*. The  
Anukr. passes unnoticed the deficiency of a syllable (unless we resolve  
*pa-árth-*) in **d**. ⌊In a supplementary note, R. reports Ppp. as  
reading in **a, b** *sa hi vṛtha-* (?) *ṛceṣṭhā mayi kṣāmaṁ bhrajasī  
viṣkabhāyati*, and as giving *jitaḥ* for *sádma* in **d**.⌋
