## Translation
2. The wind bloweth not over the earth; no one soever seeth over \[it\];  
both all the women and the dogs do thou make to sleep, going with Indra  
as companion.

## Notes
Ppp. has in **b** the preferable reading *sūryas* for *káś caná*. Part  
of our mss. (P.M.W.E.I.H.K.), with apparently all of SPP's, read  
*svāpáyas*\* at end of **c**, but both editions accept *svāpáya*, which  
the comm. also has. The comm. understands the wind to be meant as  
Indra's companion in **d**. The verse is not *bhurij*, if we read *vā́tó  
’ti* in **a**. \*⌊And so Op.⌋
