## Translation
3. The women that are lying on a bench, lying on a couch, lying in a  
litter; the women that are of pure odor—all of them we make to sleep.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
For *talpeśayā́s* in **a**, Ppp. has *puṣṭiś-*, and RV. (vii. 55.8)  
*vahyeś-*; both give *talpaśī́varīs* (Ppp. *-rī*) at end of **b**. RV.  
further mars the meter of **c** by giving *-gandhās*.
