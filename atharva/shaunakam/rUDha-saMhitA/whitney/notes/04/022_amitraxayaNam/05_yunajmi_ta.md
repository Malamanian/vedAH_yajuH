## Translation
5. I join to thee Indra who gives superiority (? *utttarā́vant*), by whom  
men conquer, are not conquered; who shall make thee sole chief of people  
(*jána*), also uppermost of kings descended from Manu.

## Notes
Ppp. reads in **a** *tam uttarāvantam indra*. TB. has in **b** *jáyāsi*  
and *parājáyāsāi*, and in the second half-verse *sá tvā ’kar ekavṛṣabháṁ  
svā́nām átho rājann utt-*. The comm. explains *uttarā́vantam* by  
*atiśayitotkarṣavantam*.
