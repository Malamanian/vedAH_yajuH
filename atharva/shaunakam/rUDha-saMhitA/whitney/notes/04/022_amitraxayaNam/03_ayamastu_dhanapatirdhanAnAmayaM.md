title = "०३ अयमस्तु धनपतिर्धनानामयं"

## Translation
3. Let this man be riches-lord of riches; let this king be people-lord  
of people; in him, O Indra, put great splendors; destitute of splendor  
make thou his foe.

## Notes
As noted above, TB. combines the last three pādas of this verse with our  
1 **a**; it reads *asmāí* instead of *asmín* at beginning of **c**. The  
comm. foolishly gives himself much vain trouble to prove that the  
epithets in **a** and **b** are not repetitious.
