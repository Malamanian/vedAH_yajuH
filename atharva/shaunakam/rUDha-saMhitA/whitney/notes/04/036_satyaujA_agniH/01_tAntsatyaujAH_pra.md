## Translation
1. Them let him of real force burn forth—Agni Vāiśvānara, the bull;  
whoso shall abuse and seek to harm us, likewise whoso shall play the  
niggard toward us.

## Notes
The comm. paraphrases *durasyāt* with *duṣṭān ivā ”caret: asmāsv  
avidyamānaṁ doṣam udbhāvayet*. The Prāt. (iii. 18) allows both *i* and  
*ī* in denominatives like *arātiy-*, and its comment quotes this word as  
example of the former.
