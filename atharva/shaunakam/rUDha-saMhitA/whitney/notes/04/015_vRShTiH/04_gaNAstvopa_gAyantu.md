## Translation
4. Let the troops of Maruts sing unto thee, O Parjanya, noisy here and  
there; let gushes of raining rain rain along the earth.

## Notes
*Pṛ́thak*, lit. 'severally, separately,' is used in these verses rather  
in the sense of 'all about, everywhere.' Ppp. has in **d** *sṛjantu* for  
*varṣantu*. The Anukr. makes the pāda-division after *mā́rutās*, and the  
*pada*-mss. mark it accordingly, thus leaving *parjanya* without excuse  
for its accentlessness; but all the mss. read so, and both editions  
follow them. Doubtless either *mā́rutās* or *parjanya* is an intrusion;  
so the meter indicates. The comm. gives in **c** *varṣantas*.
