## Translation
10. Agni, who, in unison with the waters' selves (*tanū́*), hath become  
overlord of the herbs—let him, Jātavedas, win (*van*) for us rain,  
breath for \[our\] progeny, *amṛ́ta* out of the sky.

## Notes
The comm. paraphrases *amṛtam* with *amṛtatvaprāpakam*. The Anukr. duly  
notes the redundant syllable in **d**.
