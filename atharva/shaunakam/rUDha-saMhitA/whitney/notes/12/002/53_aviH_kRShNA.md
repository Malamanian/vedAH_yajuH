## Translation
53. A black ewe \[is\] of cattle \[thy\] portion; lead, too, they call  
thy gold (? *candrá*), O flesh-eating one; ground beans ⌊are⌋ thy  
portion \[as\] oblation; seek (*sac*) thou the thicket of the  
forest-spirit (*araṇyānī́*).

## Notes
Ppp. reads (better) *uta* for *api* in **b**. The verse is quoted in  
Kāuś. 71. 6 (with vss. 4 and 7: see note to vs. 4), and again in 71. 14,  
in connection with setting down the light (*dīpa*).
