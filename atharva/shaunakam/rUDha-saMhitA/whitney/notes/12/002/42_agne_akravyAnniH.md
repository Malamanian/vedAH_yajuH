title = "४२ अग्ने अक्रव्यान्निः"

## Translation
42. O non-flesh-eating Agni, push out the flesh-eating one; bring the  
god-sacrificing one.

## Notes
The Anukr. scans this verse as 5 + 6 + 8 = 19 syllables, acknowledging  
the unelided *a* of *akravyāt*, and separating *nuda ā́ dev-*. The prose  
*yajus* (as it really is) is quoted in Kāuś. 69. 8 as accompanying the  
bringing of a light from the frying-pan (*bhraṣṭra*), and in 71. 8 with  
other verses, as noted under vs. 1 above. ⌊The first half-verse is  
defaced in Ppp.⌋
