## Translation
9. I, being sent, take the flesh-eating Agni, a death, making people  
fixed with the thunderbolt; I, knowing, separate (? *ni-śās*) him from  
the householder's fire; also in the world of the Fathers be he \[their\]  
portion.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *iṣitaṁ* in **a**, and, in **d**, *lokaṁ paramo yotu*. The  
sense of **b** is so strange that we cannot but suspect a corrupt text.  
⌊Roth would read *tṛṅhantam*, ZDMG. xlviii. 107.⌋ In **d**, nearly all  
the *saṁhitā*-mss. (all save Bs.E.) read *loké ‘pi*, which is therefore  
probably the true text. The description by the Anukr. of this fairly  
regular *triṣṭubh* is very strange.
