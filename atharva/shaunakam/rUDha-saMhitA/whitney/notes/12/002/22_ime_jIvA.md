## Translation
22. These living ones have turned away from the dead; our invocation of  
the gods hath been auspicious (*bhadrá*) today; we have gone forward  
unto dancing, unto laughter; may we, rich in heroes, address counsel.

## Notes
The verse (again with exception of **d**) is RV. x. 18. 3, and found  
also in TA. (vi. 10. 2). The last pāda in the other texts is *drā́ghīya  
ā́yuḥ prataráṁ* (TA. *-rā́ṁ*) *dádhānāḥ;* our **d** is identical with RV.  
i. 117. 25 **d**. TA.\* has *ā́ ’vavartin* in **a**, and *agāmā* in  
**c**. ⌊With **b** cf. RV. x. 53. 3 **d**.⌋ The verse is used (with vs.  
29) in Kāuś. 71. 18 and 86. 21. ⌊At vs. 30, W. wrote "speak to the  
counsel," and then interlined suggestion of "council."⌋ \*⌊TA. has also  
*prā́ñjo* for *prā́ñco*.⌋
