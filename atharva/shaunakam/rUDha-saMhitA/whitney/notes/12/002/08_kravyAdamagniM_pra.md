## Translation
8. I send far forth the flesh-eating Agni; let him go, carrying evil  
(*riprá-*), to Yama's subjects; here let this other Jātavedas carry the  
oblation, a god to the gods, foreknowing.

## Notes
The verse is also RV. x. 16. 9 (and VS. xxxv. 19 ⌊with yamarā́jyam⌋): our  
text defaces the meter of **c, d** by omitting *evá* after *ihá* and  
inserting *devás*. ⌊Cf. MGS. ii. 1. 8 and p. 149.⌋ This and the two  
following verses are used in Kāuś. 71. 12 to accompany the removed fire.  
⌊The same three vss. are quoted by the comm. to 81. 33.⌋
