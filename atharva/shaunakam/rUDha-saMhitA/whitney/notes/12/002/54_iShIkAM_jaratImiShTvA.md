## Translation
54. Having made offering of withered (? *járat*) cane (*iṣī́kā*), of  
*tilpíñja*, of *dáṇḍana*, of reeds; having made fuel of this, Indra  
removed Yama's fire.

## Notes
Various kinds of red or cane are doubtless named in **a, b**. *Jarant*  
is lit. 'aged.' Ppp. reads in **c** *tān indre ’dhmaṁ*. The Anukr. does  
not note **c** as defective; we may resolve either *índṛ-a* or *kṛtu-ā́*.  
The verse is quoted (with vss. 1, 11, 55: see note to vs. 1) in Kāuś.  
71. 5, to accompany the feeding of the flesh-eating fire.
