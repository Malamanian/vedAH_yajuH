## Translation
11. They kindle the devouring one (*sáṁkasuka*) in order to well-being,  
becoming cleansed, bright, purifying; he abandons evil (*riprá*), passes  
over sin; Agni, kindled, purifies with a good purifier.

## Notes
Ppp. combines *ene ’ti* in **c**. The Anukr. does not heed that the  
first pāda is properly *jagatī*. The verse is quoted in Kāuś. 71. 5 (see  
note to vs. 1). ⌊Caland, WZKM. viii. 368, thinks that this verse (not  
xviii. 4. 41) is intended at Kāuś. 86. 18.⌋ ⌊Over "devouring," as  
rendering of *sáṁkasuka* (which occurs in vss. 11-14, 19, 40), W. has  
interlined 'crushing' in three instances.⌋
