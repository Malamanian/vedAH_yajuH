title = "१७ यस्मिन् देवा"

## Translation
17. On what the gods wiped off, on what human beings (*manuṣyà*) also—on  
that having wiped off the drops of ghee (?), O Agni, do thou mount the  
sky.

## Notes
All our mss. have *amṛjata* unaccented save one (E.), which has  
*ásṛjata*. ⌊All of SPP's have *amṛjata* save his J., which has, s.m.,  
*ámṛjala*. *Ghṛtastā́vas* in **c** is translated after the Pet. Lexx.,  
but the rendering is in the highest degree doubtful, on account both of  
form and of sense. Probably the reading is corrupt. Ppp. gives no help,  
as most of vss. 17, 18 is lost out of the ms.; ⌊but their order appears  
to be inverted⌋. Our mss. seem to read *-stā́-* very plainly ⌊and SPP.  
reports no variant⌋, but that need not prevent our understanding instead  
*-snā́-*, if more acceptable.
