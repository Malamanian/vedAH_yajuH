## Translation
34. Having turned away from the householder's fire, go ye forth to the  
right with the flesh-eating one; do ye what is dear to the Fathers, to  
self, what is dear to the priests (*brahmán*).

## Notes
Ppp. reads, for **a, b**, *apāvartyā ’gniṁ gārhapatyaṁ kravyādā ’py etu  
dakṣiṇā;* and, in **d**, *kṛṇuta* (not *-tā*). Kāuś. 71. 4 quotes the  
verse, to accompany a corresponding action. ⌊Caland, *Todtengebräuche*,  
Note 417, would read *krávyādaḥ*, as voc.⌋
