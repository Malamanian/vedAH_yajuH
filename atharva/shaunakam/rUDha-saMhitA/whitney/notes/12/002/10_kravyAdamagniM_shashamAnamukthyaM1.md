## Translation
10. The flesh-eating Agni, active, praiseworthy, I send forth by the  
roads that the Fathers go; come thou not back by those that the gods go;  
be thou just there (*átra*); watch thou over the Fathers.

## Notes
Ppp. reads, in **c-d**, *mā devayānāis pathibhir ā gā ’trāi ’va*, which  
does not help the defective meter; of this the Anukr. takes no notice.
