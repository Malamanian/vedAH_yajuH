## Translation
6. The Ādityas, the Rudras, the Vasus \[have set\] thee again; again, O  
Agni, the priest (*brahmán*), conductor of good; Brahmaṇaspati hath set  
thee again, in order to length of life-time to a hundred autumns.

## Notes
With the first half-verse is to be compared that of VS. xii. 44 (also in  
TS. iv. 2. 3⁵; MS. i. 7. l), which inserts *sám indhatām* after  
*vásavas*, and reads, for **b**, *púnar brahmā́ṇo* (Ppp. also *brahmāṇo*)  
*vasunītha* (MS. *vasudhīte*) *yajñāíḥ* ⌊MS. agne⌋. ⌊But see also WZKM.  
xi. 120.⌋ The verse (10 + 10: 10 + 11 = 41; but **c** has really 11  
syll.) is artificially described by the Anukr. It is made in Vāit. 28.  
22 to accompany the laying of fuel in the *ukhya*.
