## Translation
1. Ascend the reeds (*naḍá*); no place for thee is here; this lead is  
thy portion; come! what *yákṣma* is in kine, \[what\] *yákṣma* in men,  
in company with that do thou go forth downward.

## Notes
This and vss. 11, 54, and 55 are quoted together in Kāuś. 71. 5, when  
putting fuel on the flesh-eating (*kravyād*) fire; also, in 71. 8, vss.  
1-4, 42, 43, 15, 16 (with iii. 21. 8), with quenching it. Ppp. combines  
*te ‘tra* in **a**.
