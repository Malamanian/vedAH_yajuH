title = "३६ यत् कृषते"

## Translation
36. What one plows, what one wins (*van*), and what one gains (*vid*) by  
pay (*vasná*)—all that is not a mortal's, if the flesh-eating one be  
unremoved.

## Notes
As usual in such cases, in most of the mss. it is wholly doubtful  
whether *vastena* or *-sne-* or *-sre-* is intended in **b**; the true  
reading is *vasnéna*. The verse, as noted above, is wanting in Ppp. Bp.  
reads *ásti* at end of **c**.
