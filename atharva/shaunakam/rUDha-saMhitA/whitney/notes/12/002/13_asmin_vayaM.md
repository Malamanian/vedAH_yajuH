## Translation
13. On this devouring Agni do we wipe off evils; we have become fit for  
sacrifice, cleansed; may he prolong our life-times.

## Notes
The verse is found also in Āp. ix. 3. 22 (following a verse resembling  
our vs. 14), which reads *saṁkusuke ‘gnāu* in **a-b**. Our mss., as  
often in such cases, vary between *tāriṣat* and *tārṣat* at the end  
(Bs.E.D.R.K. have *tārṣat*). The verse is quoted (with vss. 19, 40) in  
Kāuś. 71. 16 and 86. 19, to accompany the act of washing off (*ity  
abhyavanejayati*).
