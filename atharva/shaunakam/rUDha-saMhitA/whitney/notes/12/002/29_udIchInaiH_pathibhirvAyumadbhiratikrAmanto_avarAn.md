title = "२९ उदीचीनैः पथिभिर्वायुमद्भिरतिक्रामन्तोऽवरान्"

## Translation
29. By upward roads, full of wind, by distant (*pára*) ones, stepping  
over those that are lower (*ávara*), thrice seven times did the departed  
(*páreta*) seers bear back death with the track-obstructor.

## Notes
Ppp. reads for **b** *apakrāmanto duritaṁ parehi*. In Kāuś. 71. 18 and  
86. 21, this verse is quoted with vs. 22 'for the purpose expressed in  
the texts' (*mantroktam*); and in 71. 19 and in 86. 22 the second  
half-verse is quoted to accompany 'the effacement (*lup*) of the tracks  
to the streams.' ⌊W's "(*lup*)" was intended to express his doubt as to  
the warrantableness of Bloomfield's change of *lup* to *yup*. Caland  
expresses the same doubt, WZKM. viii. 369: cf. his *Todtengebräuche*, p.  
120.⌋
