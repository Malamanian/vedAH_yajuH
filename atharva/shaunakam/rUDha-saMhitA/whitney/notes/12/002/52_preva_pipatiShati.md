title = "५२ प्रेव पिपतिषति"

## Translation
52. He desires, as it were, to fly forth with his mind; repeatedly he  
returns again—they whom the flesh-eating Agni, from near by,  
after-knowing follows.

## Notes
We had the obscure second half-verse above as 38 **c, d**. The verse is  
wanting in Ppp., as already noted. The substitution of *patati* for  
*pipatiṣati* would rectify the meter of **a**. ⌊Pāda **b** seems clearly  
to refer to rebirth: cf. Praśna Upanishad, i. 9.⌋
