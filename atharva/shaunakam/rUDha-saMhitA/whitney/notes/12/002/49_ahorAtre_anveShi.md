## Translation
49. Day-and-night thou goest after, bearing, standing comfortable  
(*kṣemyá*), prolonging \[life\], having good heroes; bearing, O couch,  
healthful (*ánātura*), well-minded ones (m.), do thou long be for us  
smelling of men (*púrusagandhi*).

## Notes
The description of the Anukr. seems to require us to resolve *-ra-ā-tre*  
in **a**. The use by Kāuś. was noticed under the preceding verse.
