title = "५० उतैनां भेदो"

## Translation
50. And Bheda gave her not, when asked by Indra for the cow ⌊*vaśā́*⌋;  
for that offense the gods cut him off in the contest for superiority.

## Notes
Some of our mss. (Bp.E.D.K.) read *etām* (unaccented) in **a**; nearly  
all (not Bs.s.m.D.) accent *āgasó ‘vṛścan* in **d**. Ppp. has at the  
beginning *utāi ’tāṁ bh-;* its second half-verse is corrupt.
