## Translation
41. What cows the gods shaped out (*ut-kḷp*), rising up from the  
sacrifice, of them Nārada selected for himself the fearful *viliptī́*.

## Notes
The root *kḷp* (*kalpay-*) with *ud* occurs nowhere else. In **c**,  
P.M.W.I.E.p.m.R. read *viliptī́m*, which would be the more normal accus.  
of *-tī́*, but the meter is against it. But the accent *-tyám* is  
entirely inadmissible; it must be emended to *-tyàm;* ⌊cf. JAOS. x. 379.  
369⌋. What sort of a cow (*vaśā́*) is intended by *viliptī́* (which ought  
to signify 'smeared over') is altogether obscure. Ppp. reads instead  
*vilapatiṁ*.
