title = "३२ स्वधाकारेण पितृभ्यो"

## Translation
32. By offering of *svadhā́* to the Fathers, by sacrifice to the  
deities, by giving of the cow, the noble (*rājanyà*) does not incur  
(*gam*) the mother's wrath.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *devebhyaḥ* at end of **b**. The description of the Anukr.  
very unnecessarily forbids us to resolve *-bhi-aḥ* in **b**.
