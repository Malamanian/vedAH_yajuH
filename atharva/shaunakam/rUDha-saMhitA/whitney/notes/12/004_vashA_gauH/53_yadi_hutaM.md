## Translation
53. If as offered (*hu*) and if as unoffered one cooks the cow ⌊*vaśā́*⌋  
in private (*amā́*), coming into collision with the gods accompanied by  
the Brahmans, he goes supine (*jihmá*) out of the world.

## Notes
All the *saṁhitā*-mss. curiously read in **c** *sábrāhmaṇānn* (O.  
*-ṇāṁn*) *ṛtvā́;* the *pada*-text has *sá॰brāhmaṇān: ṛtvā́*. ⌊For *amā́*,  
cf. vs. 38.⌋  
  
  
  
  
  
  
⌊Here ends the fourth *anuvāka*, with 1 hymn and 53 verses. The quoted  
Anukr. says *saptabhir ūnā tu “vaśāḥ*," i.e. 'the cows\[-hymn\] is a  
\[sixty\] deficient by seven.'⌋
