## Translation
20. The gods asked for the cow, having made the Brahman their mouth; the  
wrath (*héḍa*) of them all incurs (*ni-i*) the man (*mā́nuṣa*) who gives  
not.

## Notes
The translation implies emendation in **b** to *brāhmaṇám*. Ppp. reads  
in **a** *yācanti*, which does not rectify the meter. ⌊Read *devā́so?*⌋
