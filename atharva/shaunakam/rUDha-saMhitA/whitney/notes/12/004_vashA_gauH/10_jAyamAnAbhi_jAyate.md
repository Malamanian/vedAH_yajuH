title = "१० जायमानाभि जायते"

## Translation
10. When being born, the cow (*vaśā́*) is born for (*abhí*) the gods  
together with the Brahmans; therefore she is to be given to the priests  
(*brahmán*); that people call the guarding (*gópana*) of one's  
possessions.

## Notes
The *pada*-text makes the extraordinary division *gó॰panam* ⌊for the  
sake of the play upon go 'cow'?⌋, as if the word were not a simple  
derivative from root *gup!* 'For' (*abhí*): more literally 'unto, into  
the possession of.'
