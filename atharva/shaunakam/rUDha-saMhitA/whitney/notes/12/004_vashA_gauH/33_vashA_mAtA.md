## Translation
33. The cow is mother of the noble; so came it (n.) into being in the  
beginning; they call it a non-abandonment (? *ánarpaṇa*) of her that she  
is presented to the priests (*brahmán*).

## Notes
The Pet. Lexx. render the difficult *ánarpaṇa* by 'a not giving away';  
Ludwig, by 'no restitution.' Ppp. combines *tasyā ”hur* in **c**.
