## Translation
34. As one might snatch (? *ā-lup*) from the spoon sacrificial butter  
held forth for the fire, so he who gives not the cow ⌊*vaśā́*⌋ ⌊to the  
priests⌋ falls under the wrath of Agni.

## Notes
Perhaps, 'as \[the fire\] might snatch,' etc.—seizing on the butter  
before it is duly offered. Ppp. reads for **a** *yad ājyaṁ  
pratijāgrāha*, and in **d** omits **a**, thus rectifying the meter. The  
Anukr. takes no notice of the redundant syllable in our text; we are  
doubtless to get rid of it by contracting to *agnáy’ ā́*. ⌊Were  
emendation necessary, one might be tempted to suggest *agnā́v ā́:* but cf.  
note to vs. 6 **b**.⌋
