## Translation
16. She may go about until ⌊*ā́*⌋ the space of three years, being of  
unrecognized (*vi-jñā*) speech (*-gada*); should he know the cow, O  
Nārada, then the Brahmans are to be sought.

## Notes
This is obscure, but appears to mean that the cow may not betray herself  
as a *vaśā* for as much as three years; but, as soon as she is  
recognized as such, she must be delivered over to the Brahmans. The  
*pada*-text has in **a**, of course, *evá: ā́: tr-*.
