## Translation
12. Whoever is not willing to give the cow (*gó*) of the gods to the  
sons of seers that ask for her, he falls under the wrath of the gods and  
the fury of the Brahmans.

## Notes
Ppp. reads, for **a, b**, *ya enāṁ yācadbhya ārṣeyebhyo nirucchati*. ⌊We  
had **a, b** above as 2 **c, d**, and **c** as 6 **b**.⌋
