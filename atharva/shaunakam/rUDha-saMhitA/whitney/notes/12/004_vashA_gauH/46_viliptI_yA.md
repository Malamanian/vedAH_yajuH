## Translation
46. She that is *viliptī́*, O Brihaspati, further the cow that has given  
birth to \[such\] a cow—of that one a non-Brahman who should hope for  
prosperity may not partake.

## Notes
Ppp. reads at the beginning *viluptiṁ bṛhaspataye yā ca sū-*, and in  
**c** again (as in vs. 44) *tāsāṁ*.
