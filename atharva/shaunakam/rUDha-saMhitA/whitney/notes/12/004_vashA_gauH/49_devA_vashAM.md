title = "४९ देवा वशां"

## Translation
49. The gods talked about the cow in wrath, saying: he hath not given  
it to us; with these verses (*ṛ́c*) \[they talked about\] Bheda;  
therefore indeed he perished.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Ppp. reads *upa* for *pari* in **a**, and, for **b**, *sa no rājata  
heḍitā;* and in **c** it rectifies the meter by giving *bhedasya*. The  
Anukr. does not heed the deficiency in our verse.
