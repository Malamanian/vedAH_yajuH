## Translation
13. Whatever may be his use for the cow (*vaśā́-*), he should then seek  
another \[cow\]; she, ungiven, harms a man, if he is not willing to give  
her when asked for.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Ppp. has a quite different version of **a-c**: *yasyā ’nya syād  
vaśābhogo ‘nyām icchetu barhiṣaḥ: hiṅsrā ṇi dhatsva gopatiṁ*. We should  
expect *pū́ruṣam* at end of **c**, as elsewhere in such a position.
