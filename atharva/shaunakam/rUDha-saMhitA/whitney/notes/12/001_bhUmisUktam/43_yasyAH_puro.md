title = "४३ यस्याः पुरो"

## Translation
43. Whose are the god-made strongholds; in whose field \[men\] fall out  
(? *vi-kṛ*)—the earth, womb of everything, let Prajāpati make pleasant  
(*ráṇya*) to us, spot by spot.

## Notes
⌊BR. render *viśvágarbha* by 'Alles im Schoosse tragend.'⌋ Ppp. reads  
*yasyāṁ* both times for *yasyāḥ;* also, at the end, *niṣ ṭaṇotu*. The  
Anukr. is more than usually scrupulous in calling the verse *virāj*.  
Read in **b** *vikurváte*.
