## Translation
44. Bearing treasure \[and\] good in many places hiddenly, let the earth  
give me jewel (*maṇí*), gold; giver of good, bestowing good things on  
us, let the divine one assign \[them to us\] with favoring mind.

## Notes
Ppp. ⌊puts the verse after our 30, and⌋ reads at end of **b** *dadhātu  
naḥ*. Kāuś. quotes the verse at 24. 39, as used by one who desires  
jewels or gold. ⌊So Keś., p. 322: also SPP. (*maṇihiraṇyādikāmaḥ*) at p.  
201¹⁸; but at 201²⁶ he cites the *sūtra* with Bl's reading (*maṇiṁ  
hir-*); cf. Caland, p. 66.⌋
