## Translation
13. On what earth (*bhū́mi*) they enclose the sacrificial hearth; on what  
\[earth\] men of all works extend the sacrifice; on what earth are set  
up (*mi*) the sacrificial posts, erect, bright, before the oblation—let  
that earth (*bhū́mi*), increasing, make us increase.

## Notes
Ppp. reads in **b** *viśvakarmaṇaḥ*, and in **d** reads and combines  
*śukrā ”hutyā pur-*. All the mss. accent at the end *vardhamānā́*. In  
Vāit. 15. 8, the verse is used to accompany the enclosing of the  
sacrificial hearth. In virtue of one *jagatī* pāda (**b**), the verse is  
a full *śakvarī* (56 syll.).
