title = "४० सा नो"

## Translation
40. Let that earth (*bhū́mi*) appoint unto us what riches we desire; let  
Bhaga join on after; let Indra go \[as our\] forerunner.

## Notes
For consistency, our text should read in **c** *-yun̄tām*, as called for  
by Prāt. ii. 20 (see the note). As noticed above, this verse is in Ppp.  
joined on to 37 as a part of it; in its place, as conclusion of 39, is  
given here *sā naṣ paśūn viśvarūpān dadhātu jaradaṣṭiṁ mā pṛthivī  
kṛṇotu*. ⌊In **d** of our vs. 40, Ppp. reads *indro yātu*.⌋
