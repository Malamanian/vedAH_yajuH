title = "६२ उपस्थास्ते अनमीवा"

## Translation
62. Let slanders upon thee, free from disease, free from *yákṣma*, be  
produced (*prásūta*) for us, O earth; awakening to meet our long  
lifetime, may we be tribute-bearers to thee.

## Notes
The sense of *upasthā́s* (p. *upa॰sthā́ḥ*) in **a** is doubtful; Ludwig  
renders 'laps,' as if *upásthās;* ⌊and so Bloomfield⌋; Bruce 'that shall  
dwell in thee.' The verse is quoted in Kāuś. 50. 10, in a ceremony for  
success. The description of the Anukr. is unintelligible, as the verse  
is a perfectly regular *triṣṭubh*.
