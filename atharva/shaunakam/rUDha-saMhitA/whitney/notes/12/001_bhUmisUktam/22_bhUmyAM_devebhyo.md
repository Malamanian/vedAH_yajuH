title = "२२ भूम्यां देवेभ्यो"

## Translation
22. On the earth (*bhū́mi*) they give to the gods the sacrifice, the  
oblation, duly prepared; on the earth (*bhū́mi*) mortal men (*manuṣyà*)  
live by *svadhā́*, by food; let that earth (*bhū́mi*) assign us breath,  
life-time; let earth make me one who attains old age.

## Notes
The verse (8 + 8: 8 + 8: 11 + 11 = 54) should be called by the Anukr.  
*svarāj* instead of *virāj*. Ppp. reads in **a** *juhvati* instead of  
*dadati*.
