## Translation
29. The cleansing (*vimṛ́gvan*) earth do I address, the patient (*kṣamá*)  
earth (*bhū́mi*), increasing by worship (*bráhman*); may we sit down, O  
earth (*bhū́mi*), upon thee, that bearest refreshment, prosperity  
(*puṣṭá*), food-portion, ghee.

## Notes
Ppp. reads at the beginning *vimargvāya*, in **b** *vāvṛdhānaḥ*, in  
**c** *puṣṭiṁ*, in **d** *bhāume*. The verse is quoted four times in  
Kāuś.: in 3. 8; 24. 28; 137. 40, to accompany a sitting down in  
different ceremonies; and in 90. 15, when causing a guest to stand upon  
a cushion.
