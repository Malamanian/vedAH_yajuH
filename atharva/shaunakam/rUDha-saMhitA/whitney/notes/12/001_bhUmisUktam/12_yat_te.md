## Translation
12. What is thy middle, O earth, and what thy navel, what refreshments  
(*ū́rj*) arose (*sam-bhū*) out of thy body—in them do thou set us; be  
purifying (*pū*) toward us; earth (*bhū́mi*) is mother, I am earth's son;  
Parjanya is father—let him save (fill? *pṛ*) us.

## Notes
Ppp. reads at end of **a** *yaś ca nādyā*.
