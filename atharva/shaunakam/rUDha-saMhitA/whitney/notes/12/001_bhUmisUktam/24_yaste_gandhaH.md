## Translation
24. What odor of thine entered into the blue lotus; which they brought  
together at Sūryā's wedding—the immortals, O earth, \[what\] odor in the  
beginning—with that do thou make me odorous; let no one soever hate us.

## Notes
Ppp. has again *tenā ’smān surabhīṣ kṛṇu*, and *dvakṣata*. ⌊To the  
definition of the⌋ verse (11 + 11: 11 + 8 + 8 = 49) ⌊should be added  
"*bhurij*"⌋.
