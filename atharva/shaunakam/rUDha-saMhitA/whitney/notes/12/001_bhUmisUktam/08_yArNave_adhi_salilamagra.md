## Translation
8. She who in the beginning was sea (*salilá*) upon the ocean  
(*arṇavá*); whom the skilful (*manīṣín*) moved after with their devices  
(*māyā́*); the earth whose immortal heart covered with truth is in the  
highest firmament (*vyòman*)—let that earth (*bhū́mi*) assign to us  
brilliancy, strength, in highest royalty.

## Notes
The verse is properly 11 + 12: 11 + 11; 8 + 8 = 61 syllables, and not  
very well described by the Anukr. The last two clauses perhaps have  
independent construction: '\[assign\] to us brilliancy \[and\] strength,  
\[and\] set \[us\] in highest royalty.'
