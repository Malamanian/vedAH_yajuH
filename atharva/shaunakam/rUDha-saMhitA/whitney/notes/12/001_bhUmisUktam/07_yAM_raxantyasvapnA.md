## Translation
7. She the earth (*bhū́mi pṛthivī́*), whom the gods, sleepless, defend all  
the time without failure—let her yield (*duh*) to us honey, what is  
dear; then let her sprinkle us with splendor.

## Notes
The verse is found also in MS. (iv. 14. 11), which reads in **c**  
*ghṛtám* instead of *priyám*.
