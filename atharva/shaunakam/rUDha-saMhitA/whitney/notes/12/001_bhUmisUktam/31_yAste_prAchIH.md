## Translation
31. What forward directions are thine, what upward, what are thine, O  
earth (*bhū́mi*), downward, and what behind, let those be pleasant to me  
going about; let me not fall down \[when\] supported (*śri*) on creation  
(*bhúvana*).

## Notes
The verse is found also in MS. (iv. 14. 11), which reads, for **b**,  
*yā́ś ca bhūmy adharā́g yā́ś ca paścā́;* also *śivā́s* for *syonā́s* in **c**.  
Ppp. has in **b** *bhāume ‘dharād*, and in **d** *śuśriyāṇe*. This and  
the following verse are reckoned to the *svastyayana gaṇa:* see note to  
Kāuś. 25. 36.
