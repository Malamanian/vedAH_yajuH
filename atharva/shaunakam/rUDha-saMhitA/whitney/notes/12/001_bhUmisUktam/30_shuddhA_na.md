## Translation
30. Let cleansed (*śuddhá*) waters flow for our body; what mucus (?  
*syédu*) is ours, that we deposit on him we love not (*ápriya*); with a  
purifier (*pavítra*), O earth, do I purify myself.

## Notes
Part of the *pada*-mss. (Bp. ⌊and one of SPP's⌋) accent *mā́* in **c**.  
Ppp. has *mā* for *nas* in **a**; and, in **b**, *yo me sehnur*. The  
verse is quoted in Kāuś. 58. 7 (and at second hand under 24. 24) in  
connection with rinsing the mouth after spitting; also in Vāit. 12. 6 in  
connection with easing nature.
