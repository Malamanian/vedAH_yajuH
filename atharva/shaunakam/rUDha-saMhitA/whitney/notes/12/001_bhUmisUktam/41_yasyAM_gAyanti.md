title = "४१ यस्यां गायन्ति"

## Translation
41. On whom, the earth (*bhū́mi*), mortals sing \[and\] dance with loud  
noises (? *vyāìlaba*); on whom they fight; on whom speaks the shout  
(*ākrandá*), the drum—let that earth (*bhū́mi*) push forth our rivals;  
let earth make me free from rivals.

## Notes
*Yudhyánte* should be emended to *yúdhyante*. The verse (8 + 8: 8 + 8:  
11 + 11 = 54) has no *kakubh* element in it, but as *śakvarī* it is  
*virāj*. Ppp. puts the verse after our vs. 42, and reads for **b**:  
*janā martyā dvāilavā;* ⌊in **c** *yudhyante ‘syām;* and, for **e, f**,  
*sā no bhūmiṣ pra dadhatāṁ sapatnāṅ: yo no dveṣṭy adharaṁ taṁ kṛṇotu*.
