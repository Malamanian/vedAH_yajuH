## Translation
36. Let thy hot season, O earth (*bhū́mi*), rainy season, autumn, winter,  
cool season, spring—let thine arranged seasons, years, let  
day-and-night, O earth, yield milk (*duh*) to us.

## Notes
One would expect in **c** *hāyanā́s* 'belonging to or constituting the  
year'; and Ppp., combining *hāyanā ’hor-*, favors that reading. Ppp. has  
also again *bhāume* in **a**. The irregularity of the verse (8 + 11: 10  
+ 11 = 40) indicates corruption; it is a *pan̄kti*, of course, only by  
the sum of syllables. It is quoted in Kāuś. 137. 9, as one approaches to  
measure out the sacrificial hearth. ⌊Cf. 137. 4, note.⌋
