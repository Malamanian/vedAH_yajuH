## Translation
17. The all-producing (*-sū́*) mother of herbs, the fixed earth  
(*bhū́mi*), the earth maintained by ordinance, the auspicious, the  
pleasant, may we go about over always.

## Notes
This verse (10 ⌊properly 11⌋ + 12: 12 = 34 syll.) is overlooked by the  
Anukr.; it nearly accords in structure with vs. 14, above. ⌊Dr. Ryder  
observes that the dual (*mahābṛhatyāu*) of the Anukr.-text suggests the  
possible falling out of the *pratīka* of this verse. See under vs. 14.⌋  
⌊There is a play of words in *dhármaṇā dhṛtā́m* which cannot easily be  
reproduced in translation.⌋
