## Translation
38. On whom are the seat and oblation-holder; on whom the sacrificial  
post (*yū́pa*) is planted; on whom worshipers (*brahmán*) praise (*arc*)  
with verses, with the chant, knowing the sacrificial formulas; on whom  
are joined the priests (*ṛtvíj*), for Indra to drink the soma;—

## Notes
Ppp. reads in **e** *yujyante ‘syām ṛtyavas s-*. The verse is quoted in  
Kāuś. 24. 37 to accompany an oblation ⌊and by Dārila to 24. 24, in the  
*āgrahāyaṇī* ceremony⌋. It is also reckoned with vs. 1 among the  
*puṣṭika* mantras (see note to Kāuś. 19. i). In Vāit. 15. 4, this verse  
and the two following are prescribed to accompany the *subrahmaṇyā*  
recitation; in 10. 8, it is used at the setting up of the sacrificial  
post.
