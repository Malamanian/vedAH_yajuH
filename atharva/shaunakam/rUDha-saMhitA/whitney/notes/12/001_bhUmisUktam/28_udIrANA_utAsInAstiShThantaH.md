title = "२८ उदीराणा उतासीनास्तिष्ठन्तः"

## Translation
28. Arising (*ud-īr*), also sitting, standing, striding forth, with  
right and left feet, let us not stagger upon the earth.

## Notes
The Anukr. seems to assume the resolution *-kṛ-ā-* in **b**. This verse  
and 33 below are quoted in Kāuś. 24. 33 to accompany the taking of three  
steps, while looking around, in the *āgrahāyaṇī* ceremony.
