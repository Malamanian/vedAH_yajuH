## Translation
9. On whom the circulating waters flow the same, night and day, without  
failure—let that earth (*bhū́mi*), of many streams (*-dhā́rā*) yield  
(*duh*) us milk; then let her sprinkle \[us\] with splendor.

## Notes
The Anukr. does not heed that **c** is *jagatī* pāda. ⌊In Ppp., this  
verse precedes our 7.⌋
