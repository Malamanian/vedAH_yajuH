## Translation
59. Tranquil, fragrant, pleasant, with sweet drink in her udder, rich in  
milk, let earth (*bhū́mi*) bless me, earth together with milk.

## Notes
Ppp. reads at the beginning *santivā* ⌊cf. iii. 30. 2, note⌋, and in  
**c** *no ‘dhi* (in place of *adhi*). The verse is quoted in Kāuś. 24.  
31, among many other verses from this hymn; ⌊further, by Dārila to 3. 4,  
and by Keś. to 70. 8, 9⌋.
