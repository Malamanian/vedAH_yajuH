## Translation
18. Thou hast become great, a great station (*sadhástha*) great is thy  
trembling, stirring, quaking; great Indra defends thee unremittingly. Do  
thou, O earth (*bhū́mi*), make us to shine forth as in the aspect  
(*saṁdṛ́ś*) of gold; let no one soever hate us.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *vīryeṇa* for *apramādam* in **c**, and from **e**  
⌊*samdṛśi*⌋ passes directly on to our 19 **c** (*agnir antaṣ pur-*  
etc.): probably an accidental omission. The verse (12 + 11: 8 + 8 + 8 =  
58) lacks two syllables of a full *atiśakvarī*.
