## Translation
57. As a horse the dust, she has shaken apart those people who dwelt  
upon the earth since (*yā́t*) she was born—pleasing, going at the head,  
keeper of creation (*bhúvana*), container of forest trees, of herbs.

## Notes
Ppp. reads at the beginning *aśvī ’va* and is corrupt throughout; ⌊but  
it reads *gṛbhir* like our text⌋. The Anukr. calls the first pāda an  
*atijagatī* rather than admit the abbreviated form *’va* for *iva*.
