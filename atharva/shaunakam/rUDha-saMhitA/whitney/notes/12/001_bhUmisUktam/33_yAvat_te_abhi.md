## Translation
33. How much of thee I look forth upon, O earth (*bhū́mi*), with the sun  
for ally (*medín*), so far let my sight not fail (*mī*), from one year  
(*sámā*) to another.

## Notes
Ppp. has again *bhāume* in **b**. For the use of the verse in Kāuś., see  
note to vs. 28. It is quoted also in Vāit. 27. 7 as used by one gazing  
at the earth after mounting the sacrificial post. ⌊Pāda **d** we had at  
iii. 10. i; 17. 4.⌋
