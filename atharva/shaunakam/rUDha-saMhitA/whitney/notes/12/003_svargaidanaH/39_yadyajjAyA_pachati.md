## Translation
39. What in any case thy wife cooks beyond thee, or thy husband, O  
wife, in secret from thee, that do ye unite; that be yours together;  
agreeing (? *sampāday-*) together upon one world.

## Notes
Kāuś. 62. 11 quotes the verse (*iti mantroktam*), but casts no light  
upon it. ⌊Has a second *pácati* fallen out after *jāye?*⌋
