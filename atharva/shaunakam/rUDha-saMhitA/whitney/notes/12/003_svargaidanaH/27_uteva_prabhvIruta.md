## Translation
27. Both as it were prevailing (*prabhú*) and also commensurate, also  
bright and clean, immortal—as such do ye, O waters, directed, helping,  
cook the rich-dish for the two spouses, ye of good refuge.

## Notes
The translation implies in **d** emendation of *āpaḥ॰śíkṣantīḥ* to *ā́paḥ  
śíkṣ-*, the former seeming wholly unacceptable. Ppp. combines and reads  
*praśiṣṭā ”pas sīkṣ-*. Our text reads with the mss.
