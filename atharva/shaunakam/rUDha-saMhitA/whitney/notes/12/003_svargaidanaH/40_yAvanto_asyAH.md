title = "४० यावन्तो अस्याः"

## Translation
40. How many of her fasten on (*sac*) the earth, what sons came forth  
into being from us (pl.)—all those do ye (du.) call to you in the  
vessel;. knowing the navel, the young ones (*śíśu*) shall come together.

## Notes
The mss. (excepting R.D.) leave *sacante* in **a** unaccented. Ppp.  
reads after it *‘smat*. The verse, especially the first pāda, is  
obscure. 'Navel' = 'central point, place of union.' The Anukr. does not  
heed the deficiency of a syllable in **c**; it means us, perhaps, to  
resolve *ta-ā́n*.
