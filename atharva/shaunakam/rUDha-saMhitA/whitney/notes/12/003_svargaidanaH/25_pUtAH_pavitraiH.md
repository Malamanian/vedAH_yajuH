## Translation
25. Purified with purifiers, they purify themselves from the cloud; they  
go both to heaven and to earth \[as their\] worlds; them, lively, rich  
in life, firm-standing, poured into the vessel (*pā́tra*), let the fire  
kindle about.

## Notes
Ppp. puts the verse after our vs. 26, and reads at end of **b**  
*dharmaṇā* (cf. RV. x. 16. 3 **b**), and in **c, d** *jīvadhānyāt  
sametā* ⌊cf. vs. 4⌋ *pātrā ”siktāt*. The verse is defective by a  
syllable in **a**, but the Anukr. passes this without notice. Kāuś. 61.  
34 quotes the verse to accompany putting into the strainer.
