## Translation
41. What streams (*dhā́rā*) of good (*vásu*) \[there are\], fattened with  
honey, mixed with ghee, navels of immortality—all those doth the  
heaven-goer (? *svargá*) take possession of; in sixty autumns may he  
seek unto the treasure-keepers.

## Notes
The last and obscurest pāda is identical with 34 **a**. The Anukr.  
perhaps accepts the redundant syllable of **b** and the deficient of  
**c** as balancing each other. The verse is used, with 44 below, in  
Kāuś. 62. 18, to accompany the further pouring in of juices. Ppp. reads  
*samaktās* for *prapīnās* in **a**, and *dhāmayas* at end of **b**, and  
combines *-pā ’bh-* in **d**.
