## Translation
6. Both firmaments, and worlds of both kinds, what heaven-going ones are  
conquered of the sacrificers—which one of them is chiefly (? *ágre*)  
full of light, full of honey, in that combine ye (du.) with your sons in  
old age.

## Notes
Ppp. combines in **c** *yo ‘gre*, and part of our mss. (P.M.W.T.) read  
the same.
