## Translation
5. What one your (du.) father cooks, and what one \[your\] mother, in  
order to release from evil (*riprá*) and from pollution of speech—that  
hundred-streamed, heaven-going rice-dish hath permeated (*vi-āp*) with  
greatness both firmaments (*nábhas*).

## Notes
Ppp. reads at the beginning *yaṁ vaṣ pitā*.
