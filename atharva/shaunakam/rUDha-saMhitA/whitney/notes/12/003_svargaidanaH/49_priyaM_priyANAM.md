## Translation
49. May we do what is dear to them that are dear; whosoever hate \[us\],  
let them go to darkness; milch-cow, draft-ox, each coming vigor  
(*váyas*)—let them thrust away the death that comes from men.

## Notes
Or, 'that concerns, comes upon, men' (*pāúruṣeya*). The Anukr. seems to  
accept the two redundant syllables of **c** (*evá* an intrusion) as  
compensating for the deficiency in **a**. According to Kāuś. 62. 19, the  
verse is used of 'the milch-cow etc.' north of the fire.
