## Translation
35. A maintainer, maintain thyself in the maintenance of the earth; thee  
that art unmoved let the deities make to move (*cyu*); thee shall the  
two spouses, living, having living sons, cause to remove (*ud-vas*) out  
of the fire-holder.

## Notes
Ppp. combines *-vyā ’cyutam* in **a-b**, omits the meter-disturbing (and  
probably intrusive) *tvā* of **c**, reads in **c** *-putrā*, and in  
**d** *ud vāsayāthaṣ p-*. The Anukr. takes no notice of the redundant  
syllable in our **c**. In Kāuś. 61. 41, the verse accompanies the  
removal of the vessel; in Vāit. 10. 9, the insertion of the end of the  
sacrificial post in the ground.
