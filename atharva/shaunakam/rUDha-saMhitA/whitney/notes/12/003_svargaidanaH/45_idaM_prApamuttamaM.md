## Translation
45. I have obtained this highest division of it, from which world the  
most exalted one obtained \[it\] completely; pour thou on the butter  
(*sarpís*); anoint with ghee; this is the portion of our An̄giras here.

## Notes
Ppp. has in **a** a different order of words: *idaṁ kāṇḍam uttamaṁ  
prāpam asya*. The verse (with xi. 1. 31: the first half of each) is  
quoted in Kāuś. 62. 15, and again (the second half of each) in 62. 17,  
in connection with anointing the vessel with butter.
