## Translation
12. Do thou embrace us, as a father his sons; let propitious winds blow  
here for us on the earth; what rice-dish the two deities cook here, let  
that know our penance and also truth.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *śagdā* for *bhūmāu* in **b**, and *vittam* for *vettu* at  
the end. 'That' (*tát*) in **d** is neuter, and so not correlative to  
'what' (*yám* m.) in **c**. P.M.W. read *svaja naḥ* at end of **a**. The  
verse lacks two syllables of being a good *jagatī*. ⌊The verse is quoted  
at Kāuś. 61. 4.⌋
