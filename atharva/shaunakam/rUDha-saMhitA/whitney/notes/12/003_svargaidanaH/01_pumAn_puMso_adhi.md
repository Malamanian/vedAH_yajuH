## Translation
1. Stand, a man (*púmāṅs*), upon men; go to the hide; call thither her  
who is dear to thee; of what age (? *yā́vant*) ye two first came together  
in the beginning, let that be your same age in Yama's realm.

## Notes
Ppp. combines *puṅso adhi* and omits *ihi* in **a**. Kāuś. 60. 31 has  
the verse used when the sacrificer is made to stand upon the ox-hide  
which is to be his station during the ceremony. The various antecedents  
have been prepared to the accompaniment of the first verses of xi. 1.
