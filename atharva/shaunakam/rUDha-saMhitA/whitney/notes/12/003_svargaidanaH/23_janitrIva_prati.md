## Translation
23. Mayest thou welcome as a mother a son; I unite (*sam-dhā*) thee that  
art earth with the earth; a kettle, a vessel, do not stagger upon the  
sacrificial hearth, overhung by the implements of offering \[and\] by  
sacrificial butter.

## Notes
The first pāda is apparently addressed to the earth, differently from  
the others. Ppp. puts the verse before our vs. 22, and reads in **c**  
*kumbhīr vedyāṁ saṁ carantāṁ*. One or two of our mss. (Bs.O.) read *uṣā́*  
in **c**.
