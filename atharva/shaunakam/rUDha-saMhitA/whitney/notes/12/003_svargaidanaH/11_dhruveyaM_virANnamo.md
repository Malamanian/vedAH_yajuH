## Translation
11. This fixed \[quarter\] is *virā́j;* homage be to it; let it be  
propitious to \[my\] sons and to me; do thou, O goddess Aditi, having  
all choice things, like an active herdsman defend our cooked  
\[offering\].

## Notes
The verse is quoted in Kāuś. 61. 3, next after the four preceding ones.
