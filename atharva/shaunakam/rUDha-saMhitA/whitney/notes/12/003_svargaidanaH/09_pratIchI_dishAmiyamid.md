## Translation
9. This western of the quarters verily is a thing to be preferred, in  
which Soma is over-ruler and favorer; to it resort (*śri*) ye (du.);  
attach yourselves to the well-doers; then, O paired ones, shall ye come  
into being from what is cooked.

## Notes
The last pāda is identical with 2 **d** above. But Ppp. reads instead  
*adhā pakvena saha saṁ bhavema*, which is nearly identical with vi. 119.  
2 **d** and the concluding pāda of SS-60 below. The Anukr. takes no  
notice of the deficiency of the first pāda.
