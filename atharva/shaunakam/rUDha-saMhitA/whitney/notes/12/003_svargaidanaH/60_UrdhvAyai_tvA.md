\[serpent\] as defender, to rain having arrows, we commit thee here;  
guard ye etc. etc.

## Notes
⌊Here ends the third *anuvāka*, with 1 hymn and 60 verses. The quoted  
Anukr. says *svargaḥ ṣaṣṭiḥ*, i.e., 'the *svarga*\[-hymn\] is sixty.'  
The stem *svarga*, in one form or another, occurs a dozen times in the  
hymn.⌋
