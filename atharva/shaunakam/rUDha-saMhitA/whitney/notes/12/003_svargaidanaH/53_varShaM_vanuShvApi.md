title = "५३ वर्षं वनुष्वापि"

## Translation
53. Win thou rain; go unto the gods; thou shalt make smoke fly up out of  
the skin; about to become all-expanded, ghee-backed, go thou, of like  
origin, unto that world.

## Notes
The second half-verse is identical with 19 **a, b** above. Ppp. begins  
**b** with *tatas* instead of *tvacas;* and it has a different second  
half: *viśvavyacā viśvakarmā svargas sayoniṁ lokam upa yāhy ekam*, which  
seems less unintelligible. In Kāuś. 63. 5 the verse is quoted (together  
with xi. 1. 28 **b**) with the direction 'he draws off \[the  
garment?\].'
