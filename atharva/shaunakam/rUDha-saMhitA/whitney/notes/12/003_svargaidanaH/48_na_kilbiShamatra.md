title = "४८ न किल्बिषमत्र"

## Translation
48. No offense is here, nor support (? *ādhārá*), nor that one goes  
agreeing (*sam-am*) with friends; this vessel of ours is set down not  
empty; the cooked \[dish\] shall enter again him that cooked it.

## Notes
This verse is little more intelligible than the preceding. Ppp. puts  
**c** after **d**, and reads at the end of **c** *astu* instead of  
*etat*. ⌊It is hardly worth while to discuss the accent of *ásti*.⌋
