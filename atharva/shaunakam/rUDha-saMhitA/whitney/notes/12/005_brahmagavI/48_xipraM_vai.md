## Translation
48. Quickly, indeed, about his place of burning dance the long-haired  
women, beating on the breast with the hand, making an evil din.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The mss. write no *avasāna*-mark between the two halves of the verse.  
Ppp. again reads *āilavam*. Prāt. iii. 92 notes the non-lingualization  
of *nṛt* after *pari*. ⌊Bloomfield discusses the vs., AJP. xi. 339 or  
JAOS. xv., p. xlv.⌋
