title = "०१ श्रमेण तपसा"

## Translation
1. By toil, by penance \[is she\] created, acquired by *bráhman*,  
supported (*śritá*) on righteousness.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
All our *saṁhitā*-mss. combine *vittá rté*. The appearance of meter in  
the verse (8 + 8) is perhaps not accidental; but there is no metrical  
structure elsewhere in the section.
