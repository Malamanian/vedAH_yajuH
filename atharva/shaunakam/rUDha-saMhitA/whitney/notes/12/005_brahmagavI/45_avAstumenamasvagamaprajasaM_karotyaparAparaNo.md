## Translation
45. Without abode, without home, without progeny, she makes him; he  
becomes without succession (?); he is destroyed:—

## Notes
The translation of *aparā॰paraṇá* (so the *pada*-text) is according to  
the conjecture of the Pet. Lexx. The metrical definition of the Anukr.  
implies reading *karoti ap-*.
