## Translation
20. She ascended; she came to the gods; the gods slew her; she in a  
half-month came into being; therefore for the gods they make *váṣaṭ* in  
a half-month: he understandeth the road that goes to the gods who  
knoweth thus.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *tasmād ardhamāse devebhyo juhoti: juhoty agnihotraṁ pra  
devay-*. O.K. again accent *jānā́ti*.
