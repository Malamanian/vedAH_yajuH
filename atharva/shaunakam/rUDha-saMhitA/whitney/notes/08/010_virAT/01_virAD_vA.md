## Translation
1. *Virā́j* verily was this \[universe\] in the beginning; of her when  
born everything was afraid, \[thinking\] "this one indeed will become  
this \[universe\]."

## Notes
Ppp. reads *‘jāyata* for *āsīt*, and, after *tasyās, jātāyā ’bibhed eka  
sarvam: yam eve ’dam bhaviṣyati na vayam iti.*
