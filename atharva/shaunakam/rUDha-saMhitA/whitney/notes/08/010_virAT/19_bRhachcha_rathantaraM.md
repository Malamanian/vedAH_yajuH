## Translation
19. She ascended; she came to the Fathers; the Fathers slew her; she in  
a month came into being; therefore to the Fathers they give in a month  
the monthly \[oblation\]; he understandeth the road that goes to the  
Fathers who knoweth thus.

## Notes
Again Ppp. puts *pitṛbhyas* after *māsi* ⌊R's collation, *masi*⌋, and  
then reads *dadhatas svadhāvān pitṛṣu bhavati pitṛyāṇaṁ* etc. O.R.  
accent *jānā́ti*.
