## Translation
28. She ascended; she came to the other-folks; the other-folks called to  
her: O concealment (*tirodhā́*), come! of her Kubera son of Viśravaṇa was  
young, the raw vessel \[was\] vessel; her Rajatanābhi son of Kubera  
milked; from her he milked concealment; upon that concealment the  
other-folks subsist: he concealeth all evil, becometh one to be  
subsisted upon, who knoweth thus.

## Notes
Ppp. gives everywhere *puṇyajana* instead of *itarajana* ⌊twice: third  
occurrence not noted⌋, and reads in **b** *vasuruciḥ sūryavarcaso* and  
*puṣkaraparṇaṁ* ⌊cf. our 27 **b**⌋. P.p.m. and K. read *kúveras* in  
**b**, and Bp.K. read *kāverakás* in **c**.
