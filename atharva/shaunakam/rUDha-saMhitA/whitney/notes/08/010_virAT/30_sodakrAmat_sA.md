## Translation
30. Then for whomsoever that knoweth thus one shall pour out with a  
gourd, he should reject \[it\].

## Notes
A gourd, apparently, being a too simple vessel to be respectful. ⌊The  
connection of the gourd with serpents (vss. 29, 32, 33), would seem to  
be the reason for rejection, as Dr. Ryder suggests.⌋ The readings of  
Ppp. in this division of the hymn are "confused but apparently  
essentially accordant" with those of our text. Read *tád* for *yád* at  
the beginning in our text.
