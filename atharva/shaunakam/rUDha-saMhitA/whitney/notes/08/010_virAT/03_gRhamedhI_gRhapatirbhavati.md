## Translation
3. She ascended; she descended in the fire of offering (*āhavanī́ya*): to  
his god-invocation the gods go, dear to the gods becometh he who knoweth  
thus.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The introductory clause *só ’d akrāmat*, which belongs to the paragraphs  
from here on to 29 inclusive (8-17 counting in this respect as a single  
paragraph), is omitted by the mss., according to their custom, almost  
without exception, until the last paragraph, 29, where all give it; it  
is restored throughout in our edition. R. alone gives it in this  
paragraph.
