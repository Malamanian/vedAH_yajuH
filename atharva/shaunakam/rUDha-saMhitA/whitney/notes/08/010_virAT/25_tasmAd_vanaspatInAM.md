## Translation
25. She ascended; she came to the seven seers; the seven seers called to  
her: O rich in *bráhman*, come! of her king Soma was young, meter  
\[was\] vessel; her Brihaspati son of An̄giras milked; from her he milked  
both *bráhman* and penance; upon that, both *bráhman* and penance, the  
seven seers subsist; possessed of *bráhman*-splendor, one to be  
subsisted upon, becometh he who knoweth thus.

## Notes
Ppp. puts this paragraph after our 26, and omits *rājā* after *somas* in  
**b**.
