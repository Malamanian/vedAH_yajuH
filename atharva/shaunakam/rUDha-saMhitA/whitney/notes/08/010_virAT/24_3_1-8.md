## Translation
24. She ascended; she came to men (*manuṣyà*); men called to her: O rich  
in cheer, come! of her Manu son of Vivasvant was young, earth \[was\]  
vessel; her Pṛithī son of Vena milked; from her he milked both  
cultivation (*kṛṣí*) and grain; upon those two, both cultivation and  
grain, men subsist; successful by what is cultivated (*kṛṣṭá-*), one to  
be subsisted upon, becometh he who knoweth thus.

## Notes
*Té* at beginning of **d** is rendered in accordance with the paragraphs  
that precede and follow; but the *pada*-text reads *té* simply (not *té  
íti*), as if it qualified *manuṣyā̀s*. Ppp. reads *pṛthus* for *pṛthī*.  
An accent-mark has dropped out in our edition under the *va* of  
*irāvaty* in **a**.
