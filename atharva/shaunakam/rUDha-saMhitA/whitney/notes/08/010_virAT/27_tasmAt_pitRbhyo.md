## Translation
27. She ascended; she came to the Gandharvas and Apsarases; the  
Gandharvas and Apsarases called to her: O thou of sweet (*púṇya*) odor,  
come! of her Chitraratha son of Sūryavarchas was young, the blue-lotus  
leaf \[was\] vessel; her Vasuruchi son of Sūryavarchas milked; from her  
he milked sweet odor; upon that sweet odor the Gandharvas and Apsarases  
subsist; of sweet odor, one to be subsisted upon, becometh he who  
knoweth thus.
