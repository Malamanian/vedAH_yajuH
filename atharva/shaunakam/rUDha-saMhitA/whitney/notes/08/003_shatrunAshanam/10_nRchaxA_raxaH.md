title = "१० नृचक्षा रक्षः"

## Translation
10. A men-watcher, do thou look around for the demon among the people  
(*vikṣú*); crush back his three points (*ágra*); crush, O Agni, his ribs  
with flame (*háras*); cut up threefold the root of the sorcerer.

## Notes
The comm. attempts no explanation of the 'three points,' but simply  
glosses *agra* with *uparibhāga*.
