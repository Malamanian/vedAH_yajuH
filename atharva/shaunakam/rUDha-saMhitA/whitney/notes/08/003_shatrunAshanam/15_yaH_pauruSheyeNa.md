## Translation
15. The sorcerer that smears himself (*sam-añj*) with the flesh of men,  
who with that of horses, with cattle, who bears \[off\] the milk of the  
inviolable \[cow\], O Agni—their heads cut thou into with flame.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *bharata* in **c**. ⌊The *áśveyena* of Aufrecht's RV.² seems  
to be a misprint.⌋
