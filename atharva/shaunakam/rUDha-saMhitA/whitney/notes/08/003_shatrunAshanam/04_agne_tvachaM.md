## Translation
4. O Agni, split the skin of the sorcerer; let the harmful thunderbolt  
smite him with flame (*háras*); crush his joints, O Jātavedas; let the  
flesh-eating, flesh-craving ⌊one⌋ divide him.

## Notes
RV. (vs. 5; its vs. 4 is our 6) reads *vṛkṇám* for *enam* at the end.  
The comm. understands 'a wolf or the like' in **d**, and takes *vi-ci*  
as 'scatter about, dragging him to and fro to eat him.' It more probably  
refers to the flesh-eating Agni.
