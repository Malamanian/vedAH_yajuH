title = "०६ यज्ञरिषूः संनममानो"

## Translation
6. By sacrifices, O Agni, straightening (*sam-nam*) thine arrows, by  
speech smearing their tips with thunderbolts—with them pierce in the  
heart the sorcerers; break back (*pratīcás*) their arms.

## Notes
'By sacrifices,' 'by speech'—i.e. in virtue of our offerings and praise.  
RV. (vs. 4) offers no variant; Ppp. (vs. 5) reads *śalyam* in **b**.
