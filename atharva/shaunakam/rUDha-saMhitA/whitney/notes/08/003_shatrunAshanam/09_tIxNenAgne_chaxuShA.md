## Translation
9. With sharp eye, O Agni, defend thou the sacrifice; conduct it forward  
to the Vasus, O forethoughtful one; thee that art harmful, greatly  
gleaming against the demons, let not the sorcerers injure, O  
men-watcher.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Ppp. reads *hiṅsrā* at beginning of **c**. The comm. appears to regard  
*abhiśośucānam* as a compound.
