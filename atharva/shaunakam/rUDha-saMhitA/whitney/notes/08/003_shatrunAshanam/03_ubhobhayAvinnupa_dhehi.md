## Translation
3. Apply both thy tusks, thou that hast them in both jaws (*ubhayāvín*),  
the lower one and the upper, being harmful, sharpened; also in the  
atmosphere go about, O Agni; put together thy grinders upon the  
sorcerers.

## Notes
RV. reads *dáṅṣṭrā* at end of **a**, and *rājan* for *agne* at end of  
**c**. Ppp. has *dehy* ⌊in **a**, apparently⌋ and *api* for *abhi* in  
**d**.
