## Translation
8. Proclaim thou here which that \[is\], O Agni—the sorcerer that is  
doing this; him take hold of with the fuel, O youngest \[god\]; subject  
him to the eye of the men-watcher.

## Notes
RV. inserts another *yás* at beginning of **b**, and Ppp. has the same.  
The comm. reads *kṛṇoṣi* (explaining it ⌊alternatively⌋ as = *kṛṇoti*)  
at end of **b**, and *yaviṣṭhya* at end of **c**. ⌊Better, perhaps, in  
**a**, 'Proclaim which one he \[is\]' etc.⌋
