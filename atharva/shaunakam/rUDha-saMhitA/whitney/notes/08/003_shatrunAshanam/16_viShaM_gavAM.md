title = "१६ विषं गवां"

## Translation
16. Let the sorcerers bear \[off\] poison of the kine; let them of evil  
courses fall under the wrath of Aditi; let god Savitar abandon them; let  
them lose their share of the herbs.

## Notes
'Lose': lit. 'have it conquered from them.' RV. (vs. 18: RV. inverts the  
order of our vss. 16 and 17) reads *pibantu* for *bharantām* (with Ppp.)  
in **a**, has the proper passive form *vṛścyantām* in **b** (Ppp. has  
*mṛddhyantām*), and leaves *enān* unlingualized in **c**; the  
lingualization in our text is by Prāt. iii. 80, where the commentary  
quotes this passage.
