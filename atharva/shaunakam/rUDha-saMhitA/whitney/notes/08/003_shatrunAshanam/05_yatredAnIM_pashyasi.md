## Translation
5. Wherever now, O Jātavedas, thou seest a sorcerer standing, O Agni, or  
also moving, also flying in the atmosphere, him \[as\] archer, pierce  
with a shaft, being sharpened.

## Notes
RV. (vs. 6) has a quite different **c**, *yád vā ’ntárikṣe pathíbhiḥ  
pátantam*. Ppp. (vs. 6) reads in **d** *viddhi śarvā*. Many mss.  
(including our Bp.W.E.O.T.) have *sárvā* in **d**.
