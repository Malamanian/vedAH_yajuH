## Translation
20. From behind, in front, below, and above, do thou, O Agni, a poet,  
protect us about with poesy; \[as\] friend a friend, \[as\] unaging in  
order to old age, \[as\] an immortal mortals, do thou \[protect\] us, O  
Agni.

## Notes
RV. (vs. 21) reads again *údaktāt* for *utó ’ttarā́t* in **a**, also  
*rājan* for *agne* at end of **b**, and *sákhe* at beginning of **c**;  
and it combines *-mṇé ‘gne* between **c** and **d**. The comm. has  
*martyān* in **d**.
