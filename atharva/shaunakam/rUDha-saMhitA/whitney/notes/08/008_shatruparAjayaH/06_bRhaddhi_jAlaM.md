## Translation
6. Since great \[is\] the net of the great mighty one, the vigorous  
(*vājínīvant*)—therewith do thou crowd (*ubj*) down upon all \[our\]  
foes, that no one soever of them may be released.

## Notes
Ppp. adds to our first half-verse (with *rocanāvatas* for *vāj-* in  
**b**) the second half-verse of our 7 (omitting *nyarbudaṁ* and reading  
at the end *senām*), then putting the whole after 7. All the mss. accent  
*múcyātāi*, which, though supported by the usage of sundry Vedic texts  
(including even RV.), was emended in our edition to agree with the  
Atharvan accentuation elsewhere. ⌊Henry would read *móci*, of which he  
holds *mucyā́tāi* to be a gloss.⌋
