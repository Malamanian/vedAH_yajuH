title = "११ नयतामून् मृत्युदूता"

## Translation
11. Lead ye them, O messengers of death; O messengers of Yama, restrain  
(*apa-umbh*) \[them\]; be they slain to more than thousands; let Bhava's  
club (? *matyà*) shatter them.

## Notes
Ppp. reads for **a** *mṛtyudūtā amuṁ nayata;* **d** is corrupt, but  
apparently is the same with our **d**.
