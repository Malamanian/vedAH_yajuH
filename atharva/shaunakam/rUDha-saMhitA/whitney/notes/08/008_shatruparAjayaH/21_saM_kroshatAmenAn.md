title = "२१ सं क्रोशतामेनान्"

## Translation
21. Together let heaven-and-earth yell at them; together let the  
atmosphere, along with the deities; let them not find a knower, nor a  
foundation; mutually destroying one another let them go unto death.

## Notes
The second half-verse is identical with vi. 32. 3 **c, d**, above. Ppp.  
puts *enāṅ* before *krośatām*, and adds *ubhe* at the end of **a**.
