## Translation
5. The atmosphere was the net; the great quarters \[were\] the  
net-stakes; therewith encircling \[them\], the mighty one (*śakrá*)  
scattered away the army of the barbarians (*dásyu*).

## Notes
Ppp. has an easier but virtually equivalent version of **c, d**: *tenā  
’bhidhāya senām indro dasyūn apā ’vapat.* Vss. 5-8 are translated by  
Muir (v. 88). ⌊"Net-stakes": cf. introd.—For "encircling" W. first had  
"girding"; *abhi-dhā* carries the idea of bridling, curbing, or  
restraining: cf. vss. 7, 8, 9 and note to iii. 11. 8.⌋
