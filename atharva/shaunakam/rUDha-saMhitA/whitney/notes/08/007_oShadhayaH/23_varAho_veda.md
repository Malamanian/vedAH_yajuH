title = "२३ वराहो वेद"

## Translation
23. The boar knows the plant; the mongoos knows the remedial \[herb\];  
what ones the serpents, the Gandharvas know, those I call to aid for  
him.

## Notes
One or two of our mss. (Bp.M. ⌊only one, Bp., if I understand W's  
Collation-book⌋) read *vīrúdhām* at end of **a**. Ppp. puts *sarpās*  
after *gandharvās* in **c**, and has for **d** *tā ihā ”yantv oṣadhīḥ*.
