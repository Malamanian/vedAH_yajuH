title = "१५ सिंहस्येव स्तनथोः"

## Translation
15. As at the roaring of a lion do they quake; as at fire do they  
tremble at \[the herbs when\] brought; let the *yákṣma* of kine, of men,  
go driven by the plants beyond navigable streams.

## Notes
The usual expression is 'beyond ninety-nine' such streams. Ppp. reads  
*oṣadhīnām* for *saṁ vijante* in **a**. ⌊Over "quake" W. interlines  
"shrink with fear." He would probably have changed it to "they are all  
in a tremble," as in v. 21. 4, 6.⌋
