## Translation
18. Both what plants I know, and what I see with the eye, the unknown  
and what we are acquainted with, and those in which we know what is  
brought together—

## Notes
That is, probably, their collected or concentrated virtue. Ppp. reads in  
**c** *janīmasi* for *jānīmaś ca.* ⌊We might render *ájñātās* by 'what  
we are not acquainted with,' to correspond with W's version of  
*jānīmás*.⌋
