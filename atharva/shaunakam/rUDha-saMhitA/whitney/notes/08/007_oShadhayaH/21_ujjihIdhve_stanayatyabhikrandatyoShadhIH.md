## Translation
21. Ye rise up (*ud-hā*); it thunders, it roars at \[you\], O herbs!  
when, O ye children of the spotted one, Parjanya favors you with seed.

## Notes
With the second half-verse is to be compared RV. v. 83. 4 **c, d**.  
*Pṛśnimātṛ* is elsewhere epithet only of the Maruts. The accent  
*abhikrándati* is unmotived ⌊unless, indeed, with Henry, we bring it,  
with *stanáyati*, under the domain of *yadā́*⌋.
