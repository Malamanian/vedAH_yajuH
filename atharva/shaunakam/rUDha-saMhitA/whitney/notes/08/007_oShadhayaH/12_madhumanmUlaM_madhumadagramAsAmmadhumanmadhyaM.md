## Translation
12. Rich in sweets the root, rich in sweets the tip of them, rich in  
sweets was the middle of the plants; rich in sweets the leaf, rich in  
sweets the flower of them; partaking of sweet, a drink of nectar  
(*amṛ́ta*), let them milk out ghee, food, with milk (*gó-*) as chief  
(*-purogavá*).

## Notes
The mss. (except D. and R.s.m.?) agree in the unmotived accent *babhū́va*  
at end of **b**. Ppp. has instead *balena;* also, for *sambhaktās,  
sambhūtās* 'originated,' which is easier.
