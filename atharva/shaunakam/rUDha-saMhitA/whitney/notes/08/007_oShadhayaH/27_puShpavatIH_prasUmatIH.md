title = "२७ पुष्पवतीः प्रसूमतीः"

## Translation
27. Rich in flowers, rich in shoots (*prasū́-*), rich in fruits, also  
those lacking fruits—like joint mothers, let them milk unto this man in  
order to his freedom from harm.

## Notes
Ppp. combines *saṁmātarāi ’va* in **c**. The first pāda is nearly  
identical with RV. x. 97. 3 **b**.
