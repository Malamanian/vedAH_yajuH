title = "१९ सप्त च्छन्दांसि"

## Translation
19. Seven \[are\] the meters increasing (*-úttara*) by four, the one set  
upon the other: how do the praises (*stóma*) stand firm in them? how are  
they set in the praises?

## Notes
The gender of *anyás* at beginning of **b** speaks strongly for a  
compound like the later *anyo ‘nya;* but the double accent and the  
*pada*-reading (*anyáḥ: anyásmin*) are against it. The *pada*-text  
divides *ā́rpitāni* (*ā॰árp-*) at end of **b**, but not at end of **d**.  
The verse is wanting in Ppp.
