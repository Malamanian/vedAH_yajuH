title = "०६ वैश्वानरस्य प्रतिमोपरि"

## Translation
6. Vāiśvānara's counterpart \[is\] the sky above, as far as Agni forced  
(*bādh*) apart the two firmaments; from that sixth yonder come the  
*sómas*; up from here they go unto the sixth of the day.

## Notes
For *ā́ ’múto*, in **c**, Ppp. reads *āmico*. The remainder of the hymn,  
from this verse on, is by Vāit. 33. 8 allowed to be introduced at  
pleasure in the *navarātra* ceremony.
