## Translation
2. He who caused the sea to resound (*krand*) with greatness, making a  
threefold lair (*yóni*) as he lay, the desire-milking young of the  
*virā́j;* he made his bodies secret (*gúhā*) in the distance.

## Notes
Ppp. combines *yo ‘krand-* at the beginning, and reads in **b**  
*tyabhijaṁ śayānaṁ*.
