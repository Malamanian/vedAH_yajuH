title = "२६ एको गौरेक"

## Translation
26. One \[is\] the ox, one the sole seer, one the abode, singly the  
blessings; the monster on the earth \[is\] single; the sole season is  
not in excess.

## Notes
Again Ppp. reads *sāma* for *dhāma*, and all the mss. (with Ppp.) have  
*ekaṛṣís* but *ekartús*.  
  
⌊Here ends the ninth *artha-sūkta*. It begins with *kútaḥ*. The quoted  
Anukr. here says *kutaḥ*.⌋
