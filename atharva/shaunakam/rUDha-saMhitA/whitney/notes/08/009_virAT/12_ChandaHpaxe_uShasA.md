## Translation
12. The two meter-winged dawns, greatly adorning themselves, move on  
together toward the same lair (*yóni*); spouses of the sun, they move on  
together, understanding, having ensigns, unaging, having abundant seed.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The Pet. Lexx. give the first word in the form *chándaspakṣa*, although  
Prāt. ii. 62 expressly requires *-aḥpa-*, and all the mss. read it  
except Bp., which has *-aṣpa-*. The verse is found also in TS. iv. 3.  
11¹, MS. ii. 13. 10, K. xxxix. 10. Both TS. and MS. have at the  
beginning *chándasvatī;* MS. reads *uṣásāu*, and at the end -*retasāu;*  
at end of **b**, MS. gives *anusáṁcarete* and TS. *ánu saṁcárantī;* both  
have *ví* for *sám* in **c**, and TS. *ketúṁ kṛṇvāné* for *ketumátī* in  
**d**. Ppp. reads *carati* in **c**.
