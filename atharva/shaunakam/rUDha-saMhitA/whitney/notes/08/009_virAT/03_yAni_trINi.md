title = "०३ यानि त्रीणि"

## Translation
3. What three great ones (*bṛhát*, n.) there are, the fourth of which  
\[one\] disjoins \[as\] speech—the priest (*brahmán*) may know it by  
penance, the inspired one, in which one (*ékam*) is joined, in which one  
\[is joined\].

## Notes
Ppp. reads *catvāri* instead of *trīṇi* in **a**. *Caturthám* 'fourth'  
might also be subject of 'disjoins.' Compare ix. 10. 27 (RV. i. 164.  
45).
