## Translation
1. Whence \[were\] those two born? which side (*árdha*) was that? out of  
what world? out of which earth? the two young (*vatsá*) of the *virā́j*  
rose out of the sea (*salilá*); of those I ask thee: by whether \[of  
them was\] she milked?

## Notes
The 'which' is both times *katama*, implying the existence of more than  
two; but Ppp. has instead *katarasyāḥ pṛihivyāḥ.*
