## Translation
17. Six they call the cold, and six the hot months; tell ye us the  
season, which one \[is\] in excess (*átirikta*); seven eagles  
(*suparṇá*), poets, sat down; seven meters after seven consecrations.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
None of the mss. read *śītā́nṭ ṣáḍ* in **a**, as demanded by Prāt. ii. 9.  
In **d** the construction of the two nouns is reversible.
