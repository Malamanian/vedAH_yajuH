## Translation
10. Who understandeth (*pra-vid*) the pair-ness of *virā́j?* who the  
seasons, who the ordering (*kálpa*) of her? who her steps (*kráma*), how  
many times milked out (*vi-duh*)? who her abode (*dhā́man*), how many  
times dawnings (*vyùṣṭi*)?

## Notes
The version is much more literal than intelligent, especially at the  
end, where we expect rather *vyùṣṭam* than *-ṭīs*. 'Pair-ness,'  
*mithunatvám*, means especially the condition of being a pair of  
opposite sexes.
