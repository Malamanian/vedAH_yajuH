## Translation
21. Eight \[are\] born the beings first-born of righteousness; eight, O  
Indra, are the priests (*ṛtvíj*) who are of the gods; Aditi has eight  
wombs (*yóni*), eight sons; the oblation (*havyám*) goes unto the eighth  
night.

## Notes
With **a** compare 16 **a** above; here as there all the *saṁhitā*-mss.  
combine *-já rtásya*, as in **b** all combine *indra rtv-*. Ppp. reads  
from the beginning: *aṣṭāu dhāmāni prathamajaṁ tasyā ’ṣṭe ’ndra ṛtv-;*  
and, in **d**, *api* for *abhi*.
