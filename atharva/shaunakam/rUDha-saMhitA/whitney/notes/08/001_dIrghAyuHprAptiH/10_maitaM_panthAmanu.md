## Translation
10. Do not follow that road; that is a frightful one—the one thou hast  
not gone before, that I speak of; to that darkness, O man, do not go  
forth; \[there is\] fear in the distance, safety for thee hitherward.

## Notes
⌊Kāuś. reckons the vs. to the *abhaya gaṇa*, note to 16. 8.⌋ Ppp.  
mutilates *tamas* in **c** to *tam*. The comm. reads *purastāt* in  
**d**. ⌊For *iyátha*, see *Gram.* §801 **d**.⌋
