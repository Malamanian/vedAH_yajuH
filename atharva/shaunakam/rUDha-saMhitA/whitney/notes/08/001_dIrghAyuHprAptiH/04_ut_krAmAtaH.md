title = "०४ उत् क्रामातः"

## Translation
4.. Step up from here, O man, fall not down, loosening down the fetter  
(*páḍbīśa*) of death; be not severed from this world, from the sight  
(*saṁdṛ́ś*) of fire, of the sun.

## Notes
The mss., as usual, vary between *páḍvīśam* and *páḍb-*, and SPP. adopts  
the former; the comm. has the latter.
