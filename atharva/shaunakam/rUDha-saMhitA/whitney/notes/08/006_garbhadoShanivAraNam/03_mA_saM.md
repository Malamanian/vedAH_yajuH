## Translation
3. Approach (*saṁ-vṛt*) thou not; creep thou not on; creep not down  
between the thighs; I make for her a remedy, the *bajá*, expeller of the  
ill-named.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *javam* instead of *bajam* in **d**. The comm. identifies  
*baja* with the white mustard (*śvetasarṣapa*) ⌊see introd.⌋.
