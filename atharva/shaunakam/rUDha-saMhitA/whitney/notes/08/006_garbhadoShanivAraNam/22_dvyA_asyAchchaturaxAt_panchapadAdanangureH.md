title = "२२ द्व्याऽस्याच्चतुरक्षात् पञ्चपदादनङ्गुरेः"

## Translation
22. From the two-mouthed, the four-eyed, the five-footed, the fingerless  
one, from the much twining twiner (*vṛ́nta*) that creeps forth upon  
\[one\], do thou protect \[her\] about.

## Notes
All the *pada*-mss. most absurdly divide *anam॰guréḥ* at end of **b**;  
SPP. properly emends to *anan̄guréḥ*, but why "with Sāyaṇa" is not  
evident; Ppp. reads *anan̄guleḥ;* and further has, in **c**, *vṛddhād  
adhi pra-*. SPP. seems to regard the comm. as reading *abhiprasarpataḥ*.
