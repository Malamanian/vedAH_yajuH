## Translation
18. Whoever shall handle thy embryo, or shall make it born dead—let the  
brown one, with formidable bow, make him pierced to the heart.

## Notes
The comm. explains *prati mṛśāt* by *pīḍayet*. The **a** of  
*hṛdayāvídham*, and its non-division in *pada*-text, are the subject of  
Prāt. iii. 3, iv. 68. ⌊Delete the accent mark under *tu* in **d**.⌋
