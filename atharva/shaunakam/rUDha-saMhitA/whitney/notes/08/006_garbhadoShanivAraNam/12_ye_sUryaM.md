title = "१२ ये सूर्यं"

## Translation
12. They who do not endure yonder sun, burning down from the sky, the  
niggards, buck-clothed, ill-smelling, red-mouthed, the *mákakas*, we  
make to disappear.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Ppp. reads in **c** *rāyaṁ vastavāsino*, and, in **e**, *mṛṣakān* for  
*makakān*. In *bastavāsin*, Weber understands *-vāsin* as 'smelling,'  
the Petersburg Lexicons (also Ludwig alternatively) as 'bleating' (for  
*-vāśin*); the comm. *avicarinavasanān*. ⌊For the verse-sequence in  
Ppp., see above.⌋
