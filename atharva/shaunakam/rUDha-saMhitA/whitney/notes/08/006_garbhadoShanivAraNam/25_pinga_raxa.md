title = "२५ पिङ्ग रक्ष"

## Translation
25. *Pin̄gá*, defend thou \[the child\] in process of birth; let them not  
make the male female; let not the egg-eaters injure the embryos; drive  
thou the *kimīdíns* from here.

## Notes
In **b**, lit'ly 'not make the man a woman.' Ppp. puts the *mā* after  
*pumāṅsam*.
