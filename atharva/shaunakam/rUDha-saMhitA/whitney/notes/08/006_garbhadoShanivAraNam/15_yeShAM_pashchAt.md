## Translation
15. Of whom the front-feet are behind, the heels in front, the faces in  
front, who are threshing-floor-born, dung-smoke-born, who are *úruṇḍas*  
and *maṭmaṭás*, pot-testicled, *ayāśús* (impotent?)—these from her, O  
Brahmaṇaspati, do thou make to disappear by attention (? *pratībodhá*).

## Notes
Ppp. reads in **c** *śākadh-*, in **d** *ye ca mayyajā*, and in **e**  
combines *-ṣkā ’yāś-*. Some of our mss. (Bp.P.M.W.), as of SPP's, read  
*múkhāḥ* at end of '**b**. The comm. has, for **d**, *aruṇḍā ye ca  
muṭmuṭāḥ;* he explains *ayāśavas* by *ayo vāyur vāyuvad āśugāminaḥ*.
