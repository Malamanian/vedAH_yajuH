title = "२४ ये सूर्यात्"

## Translation
24. They that creep away from the sun, as a daughter-in-law away from  
her father-in-law—let both *bajá* and *pin̄gá* pierce in into their  
heart.

## Notes
*Pari* in **a**, though compounded with the verb, has the value of a  
strengthener of the ablative sense of *sū́ryāt*, as *ádhi* in **b** of  
that of *śváśurāt*. ⌊Cf. Geldner, *Ved. Stud.* i. 270.⌋
