## Translation
6. I interpose heaven-and-earth, also the day, also the sun; let these  
gods, my representatives, drive the witchcrafts backward with the  
reverters.

## Notes
'Interpose'—i.e. between me and what I dread. Ppp. *pratisareṇa* in  
**d**, as noted above; also, for **b**, *utāi ’va brahmaṇaspatim;* and,  
at beginning of **c**, *te te devāṣ pu-*.
