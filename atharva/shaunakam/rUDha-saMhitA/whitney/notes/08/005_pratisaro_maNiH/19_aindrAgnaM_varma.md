title = "१९ ऐन्द्राग्नं वर्म"

## Translation
19. Indra-and-Agni's abundant formidable defense, which not all the gods  
together pierce through—let that, being great, save my body on all  
sides, that I may be long-lived, attaining old age.

## Notes
With **d** compare VS. xxxiv. 52 **d**, which differs from it only by  
reading at the end the irregular form *ásam*. Ppp. has *te* for *me* in  
**c**, and *asat* in **d** ⌊though the pronoun calls for *asas*⌋.
