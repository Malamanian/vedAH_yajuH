## Translation
12. He verily becomes a tiger, likewise a lion, likewise a bull,  
likewise a lessener of rivals, who bears this amulet.

## Notes
'Lessener'—lit'ly 'one who makes lean'; but, though all the mss. and  
both editions have *-kárśana*, it can hardly be otherwise than a  
misreading for *-kárṣaṇa*, which the comm. gives. Ppp. has a wholly  
different **c**, *sarvā diśo vi rājati* (as our 13 **c**), and so  
deprives us of its witness.
