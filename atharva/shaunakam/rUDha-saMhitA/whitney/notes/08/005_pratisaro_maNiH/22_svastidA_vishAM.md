## Translation
22. Giver of welfare, lord of the people, Vritra-slayer, masterful  
remover of scorners, let Indra bind ⌊for thee⌋ the amulet, \[he\] that  
has conquered, is unconquered, soma-drinking, fearless-making bull; let  
him defend thee on all sides, by day and by night on all sides.

## Notes
The majority of mss. (nearly all SPP's) put no pause at the end of **d**  
(after *aparājitaḥ*). The first two pādas are nearly the same with i.  
21. 1 **a, b**, above (and with other texts: see the note to that  
verse). Ppp. omits **a, b**, and reads (better) *sarvadā* instead of  
*sarvatas* at end of **f**. ⌊An accent-mark is lacking under the *so* of  
*somapā́ḥ*.⌋  
  
⌊Here ends the fifth *artha-sūkta*. The quoted Anukr. says *pañcame*.⌋  
  
⌊Here also ends the eighteenth *prapāṭhaka*.⌋
