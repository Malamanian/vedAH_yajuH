title = "०५ इन्द्रासोमा वर्तयतं"

## Translation
5. O Indra-and-Soma, cause \[it\] to roll forth from the sky; with  
fireheated, stone-smiting, unaging heat-weapons do ye pierce the  
devourers in the abyss; let them go to silence.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *divas* for *yuvam* in **b**; the comm. has in **d**  
*niḥsvaram*, which would be a good reading, but is against the  
*pada*-texts of both RV. and AV. (*ni॰svarám*).
