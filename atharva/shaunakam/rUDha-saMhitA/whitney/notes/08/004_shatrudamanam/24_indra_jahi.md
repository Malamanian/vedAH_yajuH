title = "२४ इन्द्र जहि"

## Translation
24. O Indra, smite the man sorcerer, likewise the woman ⌊who is⌋  
prevailing with magic (*māyā́*); let the neckless false-worshipers vanish  
(? *ṛd*); let them not see the sun moving upward.

## Notes
The obscure *ṛdantu* in **c** is glossed by the comm. with *naśyantu;*  
Ppp. reads *rujanta* instead. *śā́śadānām* the comm. explains as =  
*hiṅsatīm*.
