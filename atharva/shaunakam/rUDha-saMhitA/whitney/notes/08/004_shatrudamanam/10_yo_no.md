## Translation
10. Whoever, O Agni, tries to harm our taste of drink, of horses, of  
kine, whoever of our bodies—let the enemy, the thief, the  
theft-committer, go to want (*dabhrá*); let him be degraded with self  
and with posterity.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
RV. reads in **b** *yó áśvānāṁ yó gávām*, and the comm. does the same.  
⌊But SPP. reports that Sāyaṇa's text reads **b** thus: *ye aś. ye g. yas  
t.*⌋ A number of our mss. (P.M.W.R.K.) read *ví* for *ní* at beginning  
of **d**, but SPP. reports no such variant among his authorities. The  
form *ṣá* after *ní* here is not quoted in the Prāt. commentary. ⌊Join  
*nas* rather with the genitives of **a** and **b**?⌋
