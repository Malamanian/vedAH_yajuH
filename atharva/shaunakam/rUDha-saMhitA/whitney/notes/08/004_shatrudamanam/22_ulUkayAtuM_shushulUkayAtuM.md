## Translation
22. The owl-sorcerer, the owlet-(?)sorcerer smite thou, the dog-sorcerer  
and the cuckoo-sorcerer, the eagle-(? *suparṇá*)sorcerer and the  
vulture-sorcerer—do thou destroy (*pra-mṛṇ*) the demon, O Indra, as if  
with a mill-stone.

## Notes
As to the renderings of these various names for sorcerers, see under vs.  
20. For *śuśulūka-* Ppp. has *śulūka-*, the comm. *śiśulūka-*. The  
translation of it is a mere guess, to avoid transferring the word.
