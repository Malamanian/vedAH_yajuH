## Translation
7. Remember ye with \[your\] rapid courses; smite the haters, the  
destructive demoniacs; O Indra-and-Soma, let there not be ease (*sugá*)  
for the evil-doer, the hater that at any time vexes me.

## Notes
RV. reads, in **d**, *nas* for *mā*, and *druhā́* for *druhús*. Ppp. ends  
with (for *abhi*...) *api kā cid ud ūhuḥ*. The retention of dental *s*  
in *práti smar-* is by Prāt. ii. 102; the passage is there quoted in the  
commentary. Our comm. glosses *tujayadbhis* with *balavadbhis*, and  
attenuates the difficult *prati smarethām* to *prati gacchatam*.
