title = "०८ यो मा"

## Translation
8. Whoever reviles with untrue speeches me walking with simple mind—like  
waters grasped with the fist, let the speaker of what is not be  
\[himself\] non-existent, O Indra.

## Notes
The comm. glosses *abhicáṣṭe* with *abhiśāpaṁ karoti*. The long initial  
vowel of *ā́satas* (p. *ásataḥ*) is by Prāt. iii. 21, iv. 90; the passage  
is there quoted.
