title = "१५ अद्या मुरीय"

## Translation
15. May I die today if I am a sorcerer, or if I have burnt (*tap*) a  
man's lifetime; then let him be divided from ten heroes who vainly says  
to me "thou sorcerer."

## Notes
The comm. glosses *vīrāis* with *putrāis*, which is probably its virtual  
meaning: 'may he lose ten heroic sons.' Our *pada*-text differs from  
that of RV. by dividing *daśá॰bhiḥ* in **c**. Ppp. reads *pāuruṣasya* in  
**b**.
