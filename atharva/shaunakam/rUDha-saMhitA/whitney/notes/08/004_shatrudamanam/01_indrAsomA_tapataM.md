title = "०१ इन्द्रासोमा तपतं"

## Translation
1. O Indra-and-Soma, burn the demon, oppress (*ubj*) \[him\]; put  
(*arpay-*) down, ye two bulls, them that thrive in darkness; crush away,  
scorch down the fools (*acít*); slay, push, pin (*śā*) down the  
devourers.

## Notes
*Tamovṛ́dh* may be (so Ludwig) 'increaser of darkness.' The comm. has  
nothing better than *hiṅs* to suggest for *ubj*.
