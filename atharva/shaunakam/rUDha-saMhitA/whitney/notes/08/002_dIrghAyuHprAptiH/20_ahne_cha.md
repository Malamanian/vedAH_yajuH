## Translation
20. Both to day and to night, to them both we commit thee. Defend ye  
this man for me from the *arā́yas* that seek to devour \[him\].

## Notes
Some of SPP's authorities, also the comm. and Ppp., read *dadhmasi* at  
end of **b**. Ppp. further has *rāyebhyas* at beginning of **c**, and  
*nas* (for *me*) in **d**. The comm. explains *arāyebhyas* as =  
*adhanebhyo dhanāpahartṛbhyo vā*.
