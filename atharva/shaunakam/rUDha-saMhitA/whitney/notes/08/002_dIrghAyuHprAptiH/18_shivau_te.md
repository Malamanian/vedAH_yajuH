## Translation
18. Propitious to thee be rice and barley, free from *balā́sa*, causing  
no burning (?); these drive off the *yákṣma;* these free from distress.

## Notes
Compare Grohmann in *Ind. Stud.* ix. 399. The comm. does not connect  
*abalāsāú* with *balā́sa*, but regards it as *a-bala-asa*, and glosses it  
with *śārīrabalasyā ’kṣeptārāu*. *Adomadhāú* (cf. *adomadám*, vi. 63. 1,  
and note) is very obscure; Ppp. reads instead *adhomadhāu;* the comm.  
*adomadhū*, glossing it with *upayogānantaram madhurāu*. Ppp. reads  
*yatas* for *etāu* in both **c** and **d**, and follows it in **d** by  
*muñcata mā ’ṅhasaḥ.*
