title = "२५ सर्वो वै"

## Translation
25. Every one, verily, lives there—ox, horse, man, beast—where this  
charm (*bráhman*) is performed, a defense (*paridhí*) unto living.

## Notes
The verse has a correspondent in TA. (vi. 11. 12), but with a different  
first pāda: TA. makes it *nā vāí tátra prá mīyate* (nearly as our 24  
**c** in Ppp.).
