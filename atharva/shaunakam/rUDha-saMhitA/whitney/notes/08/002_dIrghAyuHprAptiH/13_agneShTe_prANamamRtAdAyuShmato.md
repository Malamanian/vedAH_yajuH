## Translation
13. Thy breath I win from immortal Agni, from long-lived Jātavedas, that  
thou mayest take no harm, mayest be immortal in alliance \[with him\]:  
that I make for thee; let that prove successful for thee.

## Notes
A number of the mss. (including our Bp.E.D.) read *ṛ́ṣyās* in **c**. Ppp.  
has *vanave* for *vanve* in **b**, and *yatrā* at beginning of **c**.
