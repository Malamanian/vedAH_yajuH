<h4 id="01-4">01</h4>
<p>The gods and the Asuras were in conflict; the gods, in anticipation of the contest, deposited in Agni their desirable riches (thinking),&lsquo;This will still be ours, if they defeat us. Agni desired it and went</p>
<p>away with it. The gods having defeated (the Asuras) pursued (Agni) desirous of recovering it. They sought violently to take it from him. He wept; in that he wept (arodit), that is why Rudra has his name. The tear that [1] was shed became silver; therefore silver is not a suitable gift, for it is born of tears. He who gives on the strew, in his house before the year is out they weep; therefore one should not give on the strew. Agni said, &lsquo;Let me have a share; then this will be yours.&rsquo; They replied, &lsquo;The re-establishing shall be thine alone.&rsquo; &lsquo;He shall prosper&rsquo;, he said, who shall establish the fire with me as its divinity.&rsquo; Pusan established it; therefore [2] did Pusan prosper; therefore cattle are said to be Pusan&rsquo;s. Tvastr established it; therefore did Tvastr prosper; therefore cattle are said to be Tvastr&rsquo;s. Manu established it; therefore did Manu prosper; therefore offspring are said to be Manu&rsquo;s. Dhatr established it; therefore Dhatr prospered; Dhatr is the year; therefore offspring and cattle are born in the course of the year. He who knows thus the prosperity of the re-establishing [3] prospers. He who knows his connexions becomes possessed of connexions himself. Agni desiring a share after being established assailed the offspring and cattle of the sacrifice. Having removed it, one should re-establish it; thus he unites him with his own portion; verily he is appeased. He should establish under Punarvasu; Punarvasu is the Naksatra for the re-establishing; verily by establishing it under its own deity he becomes resplendent. He establishes with Darbha grass, for variety. He establishes with Darbha; verily winning it from the waters and the plants he establishes it. The sacrificial cake is offered on five potsherds; the seasons are five; verily he wins it from the seasons and establishes it.</p>
<h4 id="02-4">02</h4>
<p>He who removes the fire casts away the sacrifice and cattle. The sacrificial cake is offered on five potsherds; the sacrifice is fivefold, cattle are fivefold; verily he wins the sacrifice and cattle. Now he who removes the fire is the slayer of the hero among the gods; Brahmans desirous of holiness did not aforetime eat his food; the Yajyas and Anuvakyas are in the Pankti metre; the sacrifice is fivefold, man is fivefold; verily making recompense to the gods for the hero he re-establishes the fire [1]. They are of a hundred syllables; man lives a hundred years and has a hundred powers; verily he rests on life and power. In that Agni when established does not prosper, (it is that he is) desiring a greater portion; in that it is all Agni&rsquo;s, that is his prosperity. Speech is uttered together in the house of him who removes the fire; the sacrificer is liable to perish on account of the uttering together of speech. There are discriminations, to sever speech and preserve the sacrificer [2]. He makes a discrimination; verily he makes the holy power (Brahman). He speaks the Yajus, muttering; it is as if one who has found a rich treasure hides it. To Agni Svistakrt he speaks aloud; it is as if one who has found a rich treasure is fain to go openly. Uttering the discrimination he makes the Vasat cry with the foresacrifice; verily he leaves not his abode. The sacrificial cake is the sacrificer, the oblations are cattle; in that he offers these libations on either side of the cake [3], he thus surrounds the sacrificer on either side with cattle. &lsquo;After performing the Yajus and collecting the apparatus&rsquo;, they say: &lsquo;the apparatus should not be collected, the Yajus should not be performed,&rsquo; they say: the apparatus should be collected and the Yajus performed, for the prosperity of the sacrifice. The sacrificial fee is a renovated chariot, a newly-sewn garment, a draught ox let loose again, for the prosperity of the re-establishing. &lsquo;Seven are thy kindling-sticks, O Agni, seven thy tongues&rsquo;; (with these words) he offers the Agnihotra. Wherever there is anything of his nature, thence [4] does he win him. Now he who removes the fire is the slayer of the hero among the gods, Varuna is the exactor of the recompense; he should make an offering on eleven potsherds to Agni and Varuna; him whom he slays and him who exacts the recompense he delights with their own portion; the sacrificer is not ruined.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Earth in depth, sky in breadth,&rsquo; he says; with this benediction he establishes it. The serpents thought that they were growing worn out; Kasarnira Kadraveya beheld this Mantra; then did they strike off their worn-out skins. With the verses of the queen of serpents he establishes the Garhapatya, and so renewing it he establishes it as immortal. Pure food did not come to the earth; she [1] beheld this Mantra; then food came to her. In that he establishes the Garhapatya with the verses of the serpent queen (it serves) for the winning of food; verily he establishes it firm in the (earth). &lsquo;If thee in anger I have scattered&rsquo;, he says; verily he conceals it from him. &lsquo;Again thee we relight&rsquo;, he says; verily he kindles him all together. &lsquo;Whatever of thee scattered in rage&rsquo;, he says; verily by means of the deities [2] he unites him. The sacrifice of him who removes the fire is split; he pays reverence with a verse containing the word Brhaspati; Brhaspati is the holy power (Brahman) of the gods; verily by holy power (Brahman) he unites the sacrifice. &lsquo;May he unite this scattered sacrifice&rsquo;, he says, for continuity, &lsquo;May the All-gods rejoice herein&rsquo;, he says; verily continuing the sacrifice he points it out to the gods. &lsquo;Seven are thy kindling-sticks, O Agni, seven thy tongues&rsquo; [3], he says, for sevenfold in seven-wise are the dear forms of Agni; verily he wins them. &lsquo;Return with strength&rsquo;, &lsquo;Return with wealth&rsquo;, (with these words) he offers oblations on either side of the sacrificial cake; verily with strength and with wealth he surrounds on either side the sacrificer. The Adityas went from this world to yonder world, they were thirsty in yonder world, having returned to this world and having established the fire, they offered these oblations; they prospered, they went to the world of heaven. He, who establishes a fire after the second establishment, should offer these oblations; be prospers with the prosperity where with the Adityas prospered.</p>

<p>There is no sacrifice without a Saman. &lsquo;As we approach the sacrifice&rsquo;, he says; verily he yokes a Stoma with it. &lsquo;Approach&rsquo;, he says; offspring and cattle approach the world; verily he approaches cattle and offspring and this world. &lsquo;After his ancient splendour&rsquo;, he says; the ancient is the world of heaven; verily he mounts upon the world of heaven. &lsquo;Agni is the head of the sky, the height&rsquo;, he says; verily he makes him the head [1] of his equals, and verily from the world of the gods he rests in the world of men. &lsquo;Here hath he first been established by the establishers&rsquo;, he says; verily he</p>
<p>makes him the principal. &lsquo;Ye twain shall be summoned, O Indra and Agni&rsquo;, he says; verily he wins might and force. &lsquo;This is thy due place of birth&rsquo;, he says; wealth is cattle; verily he wins cattle. With six (verses) he pays reverence; the seasons are six [2]; verily he rests on the seasons. With six subsequent (verses) he pays reverence; they make up twelve; the year has twelve months; verily he rests on the year. Just as a man, a horse, a cow, are worn out, so the fire when established wears out; at the end of the year he pays reverence with (verses) containing the words Agni and pu; verily he renews it and makes it unageing, and also purifies it. He pays reverence; that is his union. He pays reverence [3]; that is his bond. He pays reverence; that is his appeal. He pays reverence; that is as if an inferior brings (something) to a superior and pays him honour. &lsquo;Thou art giver of life, O Agni; give me life&rsquo;, he says, for he is a giver of life. &lsquo;Thou art giver of radiance, O Agni; give me radiance&rsquo;, he says, for he is a giver of radiance. I Thou art guardian of the body, O Agni; guard my body', he says [4], for he is a guardian of the body. &lsquo;O Agni, whatever is deficient in my body, do thou make that good for me&rsquo;, he says; &lsquo;whatever is deficient in my offspring and cattle, do thou make that good for me&rsquo;, be says in effect. &lsquo;O thou of various splendour, in safety may I reach the end of thee&rsquo;, he says; that of various splendour is the night. The Brahmans aforetime feared its not dawning; verily he wins the dawn. &lsquo;Kindling thee for a hundred winters&rsquo; [5], he says; man lives a hundred years and has a hundred powers; verily he rests on life and power. This is a pipe with projections; by it the gods made piercings of hundreds of the Asuras; in that he takes up the kindling-stick with this verse, the sacrificer hurls the hundred-slaying (verse) as a bolt against his enemy to lay (him) low without fail. &lsquo;Thou, O Agni, hast attained the radiance of the sun&rsquo;, he says; &lsquo;that thou art, thus may I be&rsquo;, he says in effect. &lsquo;Thou, O Agni, hast the radiance of the sun&rsquo;, he says; verily he invokes this blessing.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I gaze on offspring&rsquo;, he says; verily he wins all the domesticated animals. &lsquo;Ye are water; may I share your water&rsquo;, he says, for they are water. &lsquo;Ye are greatness; may I share your greatness&rsquo;, he says, for they are greatness. &lsquo;Ye are might; may I share your might&rsquo;, he says, for they are might. &lsquo;Ye are strength; may I share your strength&rsquo;, he says [1], for they are strength. &lsquo;Ye wealthy ones, stay&rsquo;, he says; the wealthy ones are cattle; verily he makes cattle stay with himself. &lsquo;Be ye here; go not hence&rsquo;, he says; verily he makes them constant, departing not. Now one fire is piled with bricks, one with cattle. &lsquo;Thou art composed Of every form&rsquo;, (with these words) he strokes the calf; verily he piles it up and makes it piled with cattle. He falls away [2] from this world who pays reverence to the Ahavaniya; he pays reverence to the Garhapatya; verily he rests on this world, and also he makes amends to the Garhapatya. He pays reverence with Gayatri verses; the Gayatri is brilliance; verily he confers brilliance upon himself; moreover in that he repeats the triad (of verses), (it serves) for continuity. Because of the Garhapatya men are born with two feet; to him who knowing thus pays reverence to the Garhapatya with (verses) of two feet [3], a hero son is born. &lsquo;With strength I gaze upon you; gaze on me with strength&rsquo;, he says; verily he invokes this blessing. &lsquo;That excellent glory of Savitr&rsquo;, he says, for instigation. &lsquo;Famous the Soma-presser&rsquo;, he says; verily he wins the Soma draught. &lsquo;Make, O lord of prayer&rsquo;, he says; verily he wins splendour. &lsquo;Never art thou barren&rsquo;, be says; no barren night does he pass [4], who knowing thus pays reverence to the fire. May we (set) thee around, O Agni, as a fort', he says; verily he sets around a barrier, that nothing be spilt. &lsquo;O Agni, lord of the house&rsquo;, he says; that is according to the text. &lsquo;For a hundred winters&rsquo;, he says; &lsquo;for a hundred winters may I kindle thee&rsquo;, he says in effect. He utters the name of his son; verily he makes him an eater of food. &lsquo;This blessing I invoke bringing light for the race&rsquo;, he should say, who has no son born; verily is born to him a son brilliant and resplendent. &lsquo;This blessing I invoke bringing light for N. N.&rsquo;, he should say who has a son born; verily he confers upon him brilliance and splendour.</p>

<p>He offers the Agnihotra; whatever there is. of the Sacrificer&rsquo;s own, that is (still) his. In the generative organ he pours seed, for Agni is the generative organ. Then he burns at the end the plants; they then grow more numerous. In that he offers in the evening, he thus pours seed, and</p>
<p>makes it productive by the morning (offering). Seed when poured does not prove fruitful unless modified by Tvastr; as many modifications of seed when poured [1] as Tvastr makes, in so many shapes does it become fruitful; the sacrificer is the divine Tvastr. He pays reverence with many (verses); verily he makes many modifications of the seed when poured. He is fruitful and day by day becomes greater, who knowing thus pays reverence to the fire. The day was the gods', the night the Asuras'. The Asuras entered night with all the precious wealth of the gods [2]; the gods thought that they were abandoned; they perceived, &lsquo;The night is Agni&rsquo;s, cattle are Agni&rsquo;s; verily let us praise Agni here; he being praised by us will restore our cattle.&rsquo; They praised Agni; be praised by them delivered their cattle from night to day; the gods having gained their cattle per formed their desires. He who knowing thus pays reverence to the fire becomes possessed of cattle [3]. The sun went from this world to yonder world; he having gone to yonder world bethought him again of this world; having returned to this world he had fear of death, for this world is, as it were, yoked with death. He reflected, &lsquo;Let me praise Agni here; he, praised, will make me go to the world of heaven.&rsquo; He praised Agni; he, praised, made him go to the world of heaven. He who [4] knowing thus pays reverence to the fire, goes to the world of heaven and lives all his days. He mounts these two fires who pays reverence to them; he acts according to the desires of one who has attained a higher place. He pays reverence at night, not in the morning, for vows are mingled at night, the bad and the good are on the same level, the fire is the light, the evening is the darkness; in that [5] he pays reverence by night, he overcomes the darkness by light. &lsquo;Should reverence be paid to the fire or not?&rsquo; they say; &lsquo;he who day by day makes a present to a man and then begs of him assuredly molests him; and who then will day by day beg of the gods?&rsquo; Then they say, &lsquo;The sacrificer sacrifices for the sake of the benediction.&rsquo; The reverence of the fire is [6] the benediction of him who has established a fire; therefore reverence should be paid to the fire. Prajapati created cattle; being created they entered day and night; he recovered them by means of the metres. In that he pays reverence with the metres, he seeks to recover his own. &lsquo;There is not monotony then&rsquo;, they say, &lsquo;if one pays reverence day by day.&rsquo; If a man pays reverence to the fire facing it, it burns him; if with averted (face), he is deprived of offspring and cattle; he should pay reverence with (face) somewhat to the side, then (the fire) does not burn him, he is not deprived of offspring or cattle.</p>

<p>Even as the Soma (sacrifices) come together in competition, so the new and full moon (sacrifices) are sacrifices which come together in competition. Whose sacrifice then do the gods approach and whose not? He, who among many sacrificers first appropriates the gods, sacrifices to them when the next day comes. The Ahavaniya is the abode of the gods, between the fires of cattle, the Garhapatya of men, the Anvaharya pacana of the fathers. He takes the fire; verily he appropriates [1] the gods in their own abode; to them he sacrifices when the next day comes. By means of a vow is Agni, lord of vows, pure, the Brahman is a supporter of vows. When about to undertake a vow he should say, &lsquo;O Agni, lord of vows, I shall perform the vow.&rsquo; Agni is the lord of vows among the gods; verily after announcement to him he undertakes the vow. At the full moon be undertakes his vow with the (strewing of the) straw, with the (driving away of the) calves at new moon; for that is their abode. &lsquo;The fires, both in the front and at the back, must be bestrewed&rsquo;, they say; men [2] indeed desire what is bestrewed, and, how much more the gods whose is a new dwelling. With him, when sacrifice is to be made on the next day, do the gods dwell, who knowing this bestrews the fire. &lsquo;The sacrificer should win both beasts of the wild and of the village&rsquo;, they say; in that he refrains from those of the village, thereby be wins them; in that he eats of the wild, thereby he wins them of the wild. If be were to fast without eating, the Pitrs would be his divinity [3]; he eats of the wild, the wild is power, and so he bestows power upon himself. If he were to fast without eating, he would be hungry; if he were to eat, Rudra would plan evil against his cattle; he partakes of water; that is neither eaten nor not eaten; he is not hungry and Rudra does not plot evil against his cattle. The sacrificer is a bolt, the enemy of man is hunger; in that he fasts without eating, he straightway smites with the bolt the enemy, hunger.</p>
<h4 id="08-5">08</h4>
<p>He who offers sacrifice without faith, they place not faith in his sacrifice. He brings waters forward, the waters are faith; verily with faith he offers sacrifice, and both gods and men place faith in his sacrifice. They say, &lsquo;They foam over the barrier, they foam over speech, but over mind they do not foam.&rsquo; He brings them forward with mind; mind is this (earth) [1]; verily with this (earth) he brings them forward. The sacrifice of him who knows thus does not spill. He collects the weapons of the sacrifice; the weapons of the sacrifice are the sacrifice; verily he collects the sacrifice. If he were to collect them one by one, they would have the Pitrs as their divinity; if all together, (they would have) men as their divinity. He collects them in pairs, and so he makes the form of the Yajya and the Anuvakya, and thus there is a pair. If a man knows the ten weapons of the sacrifice, his sacrifice</p>
<p>is in order at the beginning. The wooden sword [2], the potsherds, the offering-spoon, the basket, the black antelope skin, the pin, the mortar and pestle, the lower and upper millstones, these are the ten weapons of the sacrifice; the sacrifice of him who knows thus is in order at the beginning. If a man sacrifices after announcing the sacrifice to the gods, they delight in his sacrifice. He should as the oblation is being offered recite (the words), &lsquo;Agni, the priest, him I summon hither&rsquo; [3]. Thus he announces the sacrifice to the gods and sacrifices, and the gods delight in his sacrifice. This is the taking of the sacrifice and so after taking the sacrifice he sacrifices. After speaking he remains silent, to support the sacrifice. Now Prajapati performed the sacrifice with mind; verily he performs the sacrifice with mind to prevent the Raksases following. He who yokes the sacrifice when the yoking (time) arrives yokes it indeed among the yokers. &lsquo;Who (ka) yoketh thee? Let him yoke thee&rsquo;, he says. Ka is Prajapati&ndash;verily by Prajapati he yokes it; he yokes indeed among the yokers.</p>
<h4 id="09-4">09</h4>
<p>Prajapati created the sacrifices, the Agnihotra, the Agnistoma, the full moon sacrifice, the Ukthya, the new moon sacrifice and the Atiratra. These he meted out; the Agnistoma was the size of the Agnihotra, the Ukthya that of the full moon sacrifice, the Atiratra that of the new moon sacrifice. He who knowing thus offers the Agnihotra obtains as much as by offering the Agnistoma; he who knowing thus offers the full moon sacrifice obtains as much as by offering the Ukthya [1]; he who knowing thus offers the new moon sacrifice obtains as much as by offering the Atiratra. This sacrifice was in the beginning Paramesthin&rsquo;s, and by means of it he reached the supreme goal. He furnished Prajapati with it, and by means of it Prajapati reached the supreme goal. He furnished Indra with it, and by means of it Indra reached the supreme goal. He furnished Agni and Soma with it, and by means of it Agni and Soma reached the supreme goal. He who [2] knowing thus offers the new and full moon sacrifices reaches the supreme goal. He who sacrifices with an abundant offering is multiplied with offspring, with cattle, with pairings. &lsquo;The year has twelve months, there are twelve pairs of new and full moon sacrifices; these are to be produced&rsquo;, they say. He lets the calf go free and puts the pot on the fire: he puts down (the rice), and beats the millstones together; he scatters (the grains) and collects the potsherds; the cake [3] he puts on the fire and the melted butter; he throws the clump of grass, and gathers it in; he surrounds the Vedi and he girds the wife (of the sacrificer); he puts in place the anointing waters and the melted butter. These are the twelve pairs in the new and full moon sacrifices. He, who thus sacrifices with these, sacrifices with an abundant offering and is multiplied with offspring, with cattle, with pairings.</p>
<h4 id="10-5">10</h4>
<p>&lsquo;Thou I art secure; may I be secure among my equals&rsquo;, he says; verily he makes them secure.' &lsquo;Thou art dread; may I be dread among my equals&rsquo;; verily he makes them harmonious. &lsquo;Thou art overcoming; may I be overcoming among my equals,&rsquo; he says; verily he overthrows him who rises against him. &lsquo;I yoke thee with the divine Brahman&rsquo;, he says; this is the yoking of the fire; verily [1] with it he yokes it. With the prosperous part of the sacrifice the gods went to the world of heaven, with the unsuccessful part they overcame the Asuras. &lsquo;Whatever, O Agni, in this sacrifice of mine may be spoiled&rsquo;, he says; verily with the prosperous part of the sacrifice the sacrificer goes to the world of heaven, with the unsuccessful part he overcomes the foes. With these Vyahrtis he should set down the Agnihotra. The Agnihotra is the beginning of the sacrifice, these Vyahrtis are the Brahman; verily at the beginning of the sacrifice he makes the Brahman [2]. When the year is completed he should thus with these (Vyahrtis) perform the setting down; verily with the Brahman he surrounds the year on both sides. He who is undertaking the new and full moon and the four monthly offerings should set in place the oblations with these Vyahrtis. The new and full moon and the four monthly sacrifices are the beginning of the sacrifice, these Vyahrtis are the Brahman; verily at the beginning of the sacrifice he makes the Brahman. When the year is completed, he should thus with them (Vyahrtis) set down (the oblations), and so with the Brahman he surrounds the year on both sides. To the kingly class falls the blessing of the part of the sacrifice which is performed with the Saman [3]; to the people (falls) the blessing of what (is performed) with the Rc; now the Brahman sacrifices with an offering without a blessing; when he is about to recite the kindling-</p>

<p>He who knows the seventeenfold Prajapati as connected with the sacrifice rests secure through the sacrifice, and falls not away from the sacrifice. &lsquo;Do thou proclaim&rsquo; has four syllables; &lsquo;Be it proclaimed&rsquo; has four syllables; &lsquo;Utter&rsquo; has two syllables; &lsquo;We that do utter&rsquo; has five syllables; the Vasat has two syllables; this is the seventeenfold Prajapati as connected with the sacrifice; he who knows thus rests secure through the sacrifice and does not fall away from the sacrifice. He who knows the beginning, the support, the end of the sacrifice [1] reaches the end with a secure and uninjured sacrifice. &lsquo;Do thou proclaim&rsquo;; &lsquo;Be it proclaimed&rsquo;; &lsquo;Utter&rsquo;; &lsquo;We that do utter&rsquo;; the Vasat call, these are the beginning, the support, the end of the sacrifice; he who knows thus reaches the end with a secure and uninjured sacrifice. He who knows the milking of the generous one milks her indeed. The generous one is the sacrifice; (with the words) &lsquo;Do thou proclaim&rsquo;, he calls her; with &lsquo;Be it proclaimed&rsquo; [2], he lets (the calf) go up to her; with &lsquo;Utter&rsquo;, he raises (the pail); with &lsquo;We that do utter&rsquo;, he sits down beside her, and with the Vasat call he milks. This is the milking of the generous one; he who knows thus milks her indeed. The gods performed a sacrificial session; the quarters were dried up; they discerned this moist set of five; (with the words) &lsquo;Do thou proclaim&rsquo;, they produced the east wind; with &lsquo;Be it proclaimed&rsquo;, they caused the clouds to mass together; with &lsquo;Utter&rsquo; they begat [3] the lightning; with &lsquo;We that do sacrifice&rsquo; they made rain to fall, and with the Vasat call they caused the thunder to roll. Then for them the quarters were made to swell; for him who knows thus the quarters are made to swell. One knows Prajapati, Prajapati knows one; whom Prajapati knows, he becomes pure. This is the Prajapati of the texts, &lsquo;Do thou proclaim&rsquo;, &lsquo;Be it proclaimed&rsquo;, &lsquo;Utter&rsquo;, &lsquo;We that do utter&rsquo;, the Vasat call; he who knows thus becomes pure. &lsquo;Of the seasons spring [4] I delight&rsquo;, he says; the fore-sacrifices are the seasons; verily he delights the seasons; they delighted place themselves in order for him; the seasons are in order for him who knows thus. &lsquo;By sacrifice to the gods, Agni and Soma, may I be possessed of sight&rsquo;, he says; the sacrifice is possessed of sight through Agni and Soma; verily by means of them he confers sight upon himself. &lsquo;By sacrifice to the god Agni, may I be an eater of food&rsquo;, he says; Agni is among the gods the eater of food; verily by means of him [5] he confers the eating of food upon himself. &lsquo;Thou art a deceiver; may I be undeceived; may I deceive N. N.&rsquo;, he says; by that deceit the gods deceived the Asuras; verily by this he deceives his foe. &lsquo;By sacrifice to the gods, Agni and Soma, may I be a slayer of foes&rsquo;, he says; by means of Agni and Soma Indra slew Vrtra; verily by means of them he lays low his foe. &lsquo;By sacrifice to the gods, Indra and Agni, may I be powerful and an eater of food&rsquo;, he says; verily he becomes powerful and an eater of food. &lsquo;By sacrifice to the god Indra, may I be powerful&rsquo;, he says; verily he becomes powerful. &lsquo;By sacrifice to the god Mahendra, may I attain superiority and greatness&rsquo;, he says; verily he attains superiority and greatness. &lsquo;By sacrifice to the god Agni Svistakrt, may I attain security through the sacrifice, enjoying long life&rsquo;, he says; verily he confers long life upon himself and attains security through the sacrifice.</p>

<p>i-7-1-Cattle attend the cooked offerings of him who has established a fire-The cooked offering is the Ida; it is placed in the world of the sacrifice between the fore- and the after-offerings-Over it as it is brought up he should say, &lsquo;O thou of fair rain colour, come hither&rsquo;; the cattle are the Ida; verily he summons cattle-The gods milked the sacrifice, the sacrifice milked the Asuras; the Asuras, being milked by the sacrifice, were defeated; he, who knowing the milking of the sacrifice [1] sacrifices, milks another sacrificer-&lsquo;May the blessing of this sacrifice be fulfilled for me&rsquo;, he says; this is the milking of the sacrifice; verily with it he milks it-The cow is milked willingly, and willingly the Ida is milked for the sacrificer; these are the teats of Ida, &lsquo;Ida is invoked&rsquo;-Vayu is the calf-When the Hotr summons the Ida, then the sacrificer looking at the Hotr should in mind reflect on Vayu [2]; verily he lets the calf go to the mother-By the whole sacrifice the gods went to the world of heaven; Manu laboured with the cooked offering; the Ida went to Manu; the gods and the Asuras called severally upon her, the gods directly, the Asuras indirectly; she went to the gods; the cattle choose the gods, cattle deserted the Asuras-If he desire of a man, &lsquo;May he be without cattle&rsquo;, he should invoke the Ida indirectly for him; verily he becomes without cattle [3]-If he desire of a man, &lsquo;May he be rich in cattle&rsquo;, he should invoke the Ida directly for him; verily he becomes rich in cattle-The theologians say, &lsquo;He would invoke the Ida indeed who in invoking the Ida should invoke himself in the Ida.&rsquo; &lsquo;To us be she dear, victorious, bountiful&rsquo;, he says; verily in invoking the Ida he invokes himself in the Ida-The Ida is as it were a breach in the sacrifice; half they eat [4], half they wipe; in this regard the sacrifice of the Asuras was broken; the gods united it by the holy power (Brahman)- &lsquo;May Brhaspati extend this for us&rsquo;, he says; Brhaspati is the holy power (Brahman) of the gods; verily by the holy power (Brahman) he unites the sacrifice-&lsquo;May he unite this scattered sacrifice&rsquo;, he says, for continuity-&lsquo;May the All-gods rejoice here&rsquo;, he says; verily continuing the sacrifice he indicates it to the gods-The [5] sacrificial fee which he gives at the sacrifice his cattle accompany; he having sacrificed is like to become without cattle; &lsquo;the sacrificer must so arrange&rsquo;, they say, &lsquo;that he may place among the gods what is given, but keep his cattle with himself.&rsquo; &lsquo;Swell, O ruddy one&rsquo;, he says; the ruddy one is the sacrifice; verily he magnifies the sacrifice; thus he places among the gods what is given, but keeps his cattle with himself-&lsquo;May (my act) as I give be not destroyed&rsquo;, he says; verily he avoids destruction; &lsquo;May (my act) as I work not perish&rsquo;, he says; verily he attains prosperity.</p>

<p>Samśravas Sauvarcanasa said to Tumiñja Aupoditi: &lsquo;When thou hast been a Hotr of Sattrins, what Ida hast thou invoked?&rsquo; &lsquo;Her I have invoked&rsquo;, he said, &lsquo;who supports the gods by her expiration, men by her cross-breathing, and the Pitrs by her inspiration.&rsquo; &lsquo;Does she divide, or does she not divide&rsquo; (he asked). &lsquo;She divides&rsquo;, he replied. &lsquo;Her body then hast thou invoked&rsquo;, he said. Her body is the cow [1]; of the cow were they two talking. She who is given in the sacrifice supports the gods with her expiration; she by whom men live (supports) men by her cross-breathing; she whom they slay for the Fathers (supports) the Fathers by her inspiration; he who knows thus becomes rich in cattle. &lsquo;Her too I have invoked&rsquo;, he said, &lsquo;who is available to people as they increase.&rsquo; &lsquo;Her food then [2] hast thou invoked&rsquo;, he replied. This food is plants, plants are available to people as they increase; he who knows thus becomes an eater of food. &lsquo;Her too I have invoked&rsquo;, he said, who supports people in distress and succours them as they improve.' Her support then hast thou invoked', he replied. Her support is this (earth) [3], this (earth) supports people in distress and succours them as they improve; he who knows thus finds support. &lsquo;Her too I have invoked&rsquo;, he said, &lsquo;in whose step people drink the ghee they live upon.&rsquo; &lsquo;Does she divide, or does she not divide?&rsquo; (he asked). &lsquo;She does not divide&rsquo;, he said, &lsquo;but she propagates.&rsquo; &lsquo;Indeed hast thou invoked the Ida herself &lsquo;, he replied. The Ida is rain; in the step of rain people drink the ghee they live upon; he who knows thus is propagated with offspring; he becomes an eater of food.</p>
<h4 id="03-6">03</h4>
<p>Secretly offering is made to one set of gods, openly to another. The gods who receive offering secretly, he thus offers to them in sacrifice; in that he brings the Anvaharya mess&ndash;the Brahmans are the gods openly&ndash;them he verily delights. This is his sacrificial fee: verily he mends the rent in the sacrifice; whatever in the sacrifice is harsh or is injured, that he makes good (anvaharati) [1] with the Anvaharya mess, and that is why it has its name. Now the priests are the messengers of the gods; in that he brings the Anvaharya mess, he delights the messengers of the gods. Prajapati distributed the sacrifice to the gods; he reflected that he was empty; he per ceived this Anvaharya mess unallotted; he conferred it upon himself. The Anvaharya is connected with Prajapati; he, who knowing thus brings the Anvaharya, assuredly enjoys Prajapati. An unlimited amount should be poured out, Prajapati is unlimited; (verily it serves) to win Prajapati [2]. Whatever the gods did in the sacrifice, the Asuras did; the gods perceived the Anvaharya connected with Prajapati; they seized it - then the gods prospered, the Asuras were defeated; he who knowing thus brings the Anvaharya prospers himself, his foe is defeated. By the sacrifice there is offering, by the cooked food satisfying. He who knowing thus brings the Anvaharya, accomplishes at once sacrifice and satisfaction. &lsquo;Thou art the portion of Prajapati&rsquo; [3], he says; verily he unites Prajapati with his own portion. &lsquo;Full of strength and milk&rsquo;, he says; verily he confers upon him strength and milk. &lsquo;Protect my expiration and inspiration; protect my breathing together and cross-breathing&rsquo;, he says; verily he invokes this blessing. &lsquo;Thou art imperishable, for imperishableness thee; mayst thou not perish for me, yonder, in yonder world&rsquo;, he says. Food perishes in yonder world, for given hence in yonder world people live upon it; in that he touches thus, he makes it imperishable; his food perishes not in yonder world.</p>
<h4 id="04-6">04</h4>
<p>&lsquo;By I sacrifice to the divine strew, may I be possessed of children&rsquo;, he says; by the strew Prajapati created offspring, verily he creates offspring. &lsquo;By sacrifice to the god Naraśansa, may I be possessed of cattle&rsquo;, he says; by Naraśansa Prajapati created cattle; verily he creates cattle. &lsquo;By sacrifice to the god, Agni Svistakrt, may I attain security through the sacrifice, having long life&rsquo;, he says; verily he confers life on himself, and finds support through the sacrifice. With the victory of the new and full moon sacrifices [1] the gods conquered, and by means of the new and full moon sacrifices they drove away the Asuras. &lsquo;May I be victorious through the victory of Agni&rsquo;, he says; verily through the victory of the deities in the new and full moon sacrifices the sacrificer is victorious, and by means of the new and full moon offerings drives away his enemies. With two verses containing the word &lsquo;strength&rsquo;, he accompanies the separation (of the ladles) strength is food verily he wins food; (he uses) two, for support. He who sacrifices knowing the two milkings of the sacrifice milks thus</p>
<p>the sacrifice on both sides [2], in front and behind; this is one milking of the sacrifice, another is in the Ida. When the Hotr utters the name of the sacrificer, then he should say, &lsquo;Hither these blessings have come, fain for milking&rsquo;; verily he milks the deities which he praises together; verily he milks<br>
the sacrifice on both sides, in front and behind. &lsquo;With the red steed may Agni convey thee to the god&rsquo;, he says; these are the steeds of the gods [3], the straw is the sacrificer; in that he casts forward the straw with them, he makes the sacrificers to go by the steeds of the gods to the world of heaven. &lsquo;I unyoke thy head ropes, thy reins&rsquo;, he says; that is the unyoking of Agni; verily thereby he unyokes him. &lsquo;By sacrifice to the god Visnu, by the sacrifice may I attain health and wealth and security&rsquo;, he says; Visnu is the sacrifice; verily the sacrifice finds support at the end. &lsquo;By sacrifice to the god Soma, possessing good seed [4], may I impregnate seed&rsquo;, he says; Soma is the impregnator of seed; verily he confers seed upon himself. &lsquo;By sacrifice to the god Tvastr, may I prosper the form of cattle&rsquo;; Tvastr is the form-maker of the pairings of cattle, and thereby he confers upon himself the form of cattle. &lsquo;The wives of the gods, Agni, the lord of the house, are the pair of the sacrifice; by sacrifice to these deities may I be propagated with a pair.&rsquo; &lsquo;Thou art the bundle, thou art gain, may I gain&rsquo;, he says; by the bundle (vedena) the gods won (avindanta) the desirable wealth of the Asuras, and that is why the bundle has its name. Whatever of his foe&rsquo;s he may covet, the name of that he should utter; verily he wing it all from him. &lsquo;May the bundle bestow increase of wealth, rich in ghee, rich in houses, a thousandfold, strong&rsquo;, he says; he obtains a thousand cattle. In his offspring a strong one is born who knows thus.</p>
<h4 id="05-6">05</h4>
<p>Through the emptying of the Dhruva the sacrifice is emptied, through the sacrifice the sacrificer, through the sacrificer offspring. Through the swelling of the Dhruva, the sacrifice is made to swell, through the sacrifice the sacrificer, through the sacrificer offspring. &lsquo;Let the Dhruva swell with ghee&rsquo;, he says; verily he makes the Dhruva to swell; through its swelling the sacrifice is made to swell, through the sacrifice the sacri ficer, throuoh the sacrificer offspring. &lsquo;Prajapati&rsquo;s is the world called Vibhan. In it I place thee along with the sacrificer&rsquo;, he says [1]; the world of Prajapati, named Vibhan, is this (world); verily he places it in it along with the sacrificer. In that he sacrifices he is as it were emptied; in that he eats the sacrificer&rsquo;s portion, he fills himself. The sacrifice is the size of the sacrificer&rsquo;s portion, the sacrificer is the sacrifice; in that he eats the sacrificer&rsquo;s portion, he places the sacrifice in the sacrifice. There is good grass and good water where the strew and the waters are [2]; the Vedi is the abode of the sacrificer; in that he places the full bowl within the Vedi, he establishes good grass and good water in his own abode. &lsquo;Thou art real, be real for me&rsquo;, he says; the sacrifice is the waters, ambrosia is the water; verily he bestows upon himself the sacrifice and the waters. All creatures attend him who is performing the vow. &lsquo;In the eastern quarter may the gods, the priests, make (me) bright&rsquo;, he says; this is the concluding bath of the new and full moon sacrifices [3]. He goes to the bath along with the creatures which attend him as he performs the vow. Headed by Visnu the gods won these worlds by the metres so as to be irrecoverable; in that he takes the steps of Visnu the sacrificer becoming Visnu wins these worlds by the metres so as to be irrecoverable. &lsquo;Thou art the step of Visnu, smiting imprecations&rsquo;, he says; the earth is the Gayatri, the atmosphere is connected with the Tristubh, the sky is the Jagati, the quarters are connected with the Anustubh; verily by the metres he wins these worlds in order.</p>
<h4 id="06-6">06</h4>
<p>&lsquo;We have come to the heaven: to the heaven we have come&rsquo;, he says; verily he goes to the world of heaven. &lsquo;May I not be cut off from seeing thee; what heat is thine, to that of thee may I not be brought low&rsquo;, he says; that is according to the text. &lsquo;Thou art good, the best of rays; thou art life bestowing, bestow life upon me&rsquo;, he says; verily he invokes this blessing. He falls away from this world, who [1] takes the steps of Visnu, for from the world of heaven the steps of Visnu are taken. The theologians say, &lsquo;He indeed would take the steps of Visnu who after acquiring these worlds of his foe should descend again to this world.&rsquo; This is his return descent to this world, in that he says,&lsquo;Here do I exclude my enemy N. N. from these quarters, from this sky&rsquo;; verily having acquired these worlds of his foe he descends again to this world. &lsquo;I have been united [2] with the light&rsquo;, he</p>
<p>says; verily he rests on this world. &lsquo;I turn the turning of Indra&rsquo;, he says; Indra is yonder sun; verily he turns his turning. He turns to the right; verily he revolves round his own strength; therefore the right side of a man is the stronger; verily also he turns the turning of the sun. &lsquo;May I be united with offspring, offspring with me&rsquo;, he says; verily [3] he invokes this blessing. &lsquo;Kindled, O Agni, shine<br>
for me; kindling thee, O Agni, may I shine&rsquo;, he says; that is according to the text. &lsquo;Be rich the sacrifice; may I be rich&rsquo;, he says; verily he invokes this blessing. Within the Garhapatya much variegated work is performed; with two verses to Agni, the purifier, he pays reverence to the Garhapatya; verily he purifies the fire, he purifies himself; (he uses) two for support. &lsquo;O Agni, lord of the house&rsquo;, he says [4]; that is according to the text. &lsquo;For a hundred winters&rsquo;, he says; &lsquo;for a hundred winters may I kindle thee&rsquo;, he says in effect. He utters the name of his son; verily he makes him an eater of food. &lsquo;This prayer I utter, bringing light for the race&rsquo;, he should say who has no son born to him, verily is born to him a brilliant and resplendent son. &lsquo;This prayer I utter, bringing light to N. N.&rsquo;, he should say who has a son born [5]; verily he bestows upon him brilliance and splendour. He who having yoked the sacrifice does not let it free becomes without a support. &lsquo;Who yoketh thee? Let him set thee free&rsquo;, he says; Who (ka) is Prajapati; verily by Prajapati he yokes him, by Prajapati he lets him free, for support. The vow if not released is liable to consume (the sacrificer); &lsquo;O Agni, lord of vows, I have performed my vow&rsquo;, he says; verily he releases his vow [6], for atonement, to prevent burning. The sacrifice goes away, and turns not back; to him who sacrifices knowing the restoration of the sacrifice it does turn back; &lsquo;The sacrifice hath become, it hath come into being&rsquo;, he says; this is the restoration of the sacrifice, and thereby he restores it. Excellence has not been obtained by him who having established a fire has no retinue; cattle indeed are the retinue of a Brahman. Having sacrificed, he should step forward to the east and say, &lsquo;Rich in cattle, in sheep, O Agni, in horses is the sacrificer&rsquo;; he wins his retinue, he obtains a thousand cattle, in his offspring a strong one is born.<br>

Because the Gayatri remained away, therefore they style this offering the Gayatri; the Gayatri is the year, so the year remained away; because the gods thereby appropriated the force, might, power, strength [2], offspring, and cattle of the Asuras, therefore they style this offering the gatherer.

<p>He who desires cattle should sacrifice with the Çitra (offering); Çitra is this (earth); in that in this (earth) all things are produced, thereby is this (earth) variegated (citra); he who knowing thus sacrifices with the Çitra desirous of cattle is propagated with offspring, with cattle, with pairings. With the offering to Agni he strews, with that to Soma he impregnates seed, the seed impregnated Tvastr develops into forms; there are (offerings) to Sarasvant and Sarasvati; that is the divine pair; verily in the midst he bestows upon him a divine [1] pair, for growth, for propagation. There is an oblation to Sinivali; Sinivali is speech, speech is growth; verily he approaches speech and growth. The last is to Indra, and thereby there is a pair. Seven are these offerings, the tame animals are seven, the wild seven; the metres are seven, for the winning of both. Then he offers these oblations; these gods are the lords of growth; verily they bestow growth upon him, he grows with offspring and cattle; moreover in that he offers these oblations, (they serve) for support.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thou art connected with the Maruts, thou art the force of the Maruts&rsquo;, (with these words) he puts on a black garment with a black fringe; that is the hue of rain; verily becoming of like hue he causes Parjanya to rain. &lsquo;Stay, O Maruts, the speeding falcon&rsquo;, (with these words) he pushes back the west wind; verily he produces the east wind, to win the rains. He makes offering to the names of the wind; the wind rules the rain; verily he has recourse to the wind with its own share; verily it makes Parjanya rain for him. Eight offerings [1] he makes; the quarters are four, the intermediate quarters are four; verily from the quarters he makes the rain to move. He unites (them) on a black antelope skin; verily he makes the offering; he unites within the Vedi, for accomplishment. When the Yatis were being eaten, their heads fell away; they became Kharjuras; their sap rose upwards, they became Kariras; the Kariras are connected with Soma; the offering connected with Soma makes rain to move from the sky; in that there are Kariras (in the sacrifice) [2], by means of an offering which is connected with Soma he wins the rain from the sky. With honey he unites (them); honey is the sap of the waters and the plants; verily it rains from the waters and the plants; verily also he brings down rain from the waters and the plants. &lsquo;Gladdening, obedient&rsquo;, (with these words) he unites (them); verily he approaches them by their names; just as one may say, &lsquo;Come hither, N. N.&rsquo;, so by their names [3] he makes them move forward. Thou art the fetter of the strong horse; for rain I yoke thee&rsquo;, he says the horse is strong, Parjanya is strong; becoming black as it were he rains; verily he unites him with his hue, to win the rains.</p>

<p>&lsquo;O gods having wealth, O gods granting protection, O gods drinking together&rsquo;, (with these words) he ties on; verily by means of the gods he daily seeks rain. If it should rain, so much only should be offered; if it should not rain, on the next day he should offer an oblation. Mitra and Varuna are day and night, by day and night Parjanya rains, for by night or by day he rains; verily he has recourse to Mitra and Varuna with their own share; verily they [1] make Parjanya rain for him by day and night. To Agni, hiding his abode, he should offer a cake on eight potsherds, to the Maruts on seven potsherds, to Surya on one potsherd; Agni thence causes the rain to arise, the Maruts lead it out when produced; when yonder Sun Moves low with his rays, then he rains; becoming a hider of his abode, as it were, he rains; these deities are the lords of rain; them he has recourse to with their own share; they [2] make Parjanya rain for him; even if he is not minded to rain yet he rains. &lsquo;Let free the rain from heaven; with waters fill the ocean&rsquo;, he says; verily these and yonder waters he unites; then with these he approaches yonder (waters). &lsquo;Thou art born of waters, first-born; thou art the might of the ocean&rsquo;, he says; that is according to the text. &lsquo;Flood the earth&rsquo;, (with these words) he offers in a Boerhavia procumbens; this of plants is that which wins rain, and thereby he causes rain to fall. &lsquo;The gods whose portion is in the sky&rsquo;, (with these words) he shakes the black antelope skin; verily to him these worlds become dear and desired.</p>

<p>&lsquo;All&rsquo; the metres are to be recited in this sacrifice', they say; the Kakubh is the strength of the Tristubh, the Usnih of the Jagati; in that he repeats the Usnih and the Kakubh, thereby he wins all the metres. The Usnih is the Gayatri; the four syllables over are fourfooted cattle; just as cake is over cake, so it is with the syllables which are over the verse; if he were to close with a Jagati [1], he would end the sacrifice; he closes with a Tristubh, the Tristubh is power and strength; verily he establishes the sacrifice on power and strength, he does not end it. &lsquo;O Agni, three are thy strengths, three thy abodes&rsquo;, with this (verse) containing the word &lsquo;three&rsquo; he closes, for similarity of form: that which has three constituents is the whole of the sacrifice; for every desire it is employed, for the sacrifice is employed for all desires. He who is practising witchcraft should sacrifice with that of three constituents; that which has three constituents is the whole of the sacrifice [2]; verily with the whole of the sacrifice he bewitches him, and lays him low. With the same (offering) should he sacrifice who is practised against, that which has three constituents is the whole of the sacrifice; verily he sacrifices with the whole of the sacrifice, and he who practises witchcraft does not lay him low. With the same (offering) should he sacrifice who is going to sacrifice with a thousand; verily he produces and gives (it). He who has sacrificed with a thousand should sacrifice with the same (offering) he goes to the end of cattle [3] who sacrifices with a thousand; Prajapati created cattle; he created them with (the offering) of three constituents; he who knowing thus sacrifices, desirous of cattle, with (the offering) of three constituents, creates cattle from the very source whence Prajapati created them; and the thousand resorts to him. He becomes a prey to the gods who having said, &lsquo;I shall sacrifice&rsquo;, does not sacrifice; he should sacrifice with (the offering) of three constituents; (the offering) of three constituents [4] is the whole of the sacrifice; verily he sacrifices with the whole of the sacrifice, and does not become a prey to the gods. The cake is on twelve potsherds; these are three (sets of) four potsherds, to bring about the three. There are three cakes, these worlds are three; (verily they serve) to win these worlds. Each one above the other is larger, for so as it were are these worlds. The middle one is made of barley, that is the form of the atmosphere; (verily it serves) for prosperity. He cuts off from all (the cakes) as he sets them up without making a failure. He gives gold; verily he wins brilliance [5]; he gives the silken garment; verily he wins cattle; he gives a cow; verily he wins his prayers; gold is the colour of the Saman, the silken garment of the formulae, the cow of the praises and rejoicings; verily he wins all these colours.</p>

<p>Tvastr, his son slain, offered Soma excluding Indra. Indra desired an invitation to the rite, but he did not invite him, (saying), &lsquo;Thou hast slain my son.&rsquo; He made a disturbance of the sacrifice, and forcibly drank the Soma. The remains of it Tvastr cast upon the Ahavaniya (fire), saying, &lsquo;Hail! wax great, Indra&rsquo;s foe. While (the fire) was flaming upwards to strike, just then of itself it stayed;</p>
<p>whether so much was before [1], or so much was over the fire, be sprang up alive and came into union with Agni and Soma. He grew on all sides an arrow(shot), he enveloped these worlds. Because he enveloped these worlds, therefore is Vrtra, Vrtra. Indra feared him, and Tvastr too; Tvastr dipped his bolt for him; the bolt was fervour; he could not restrain it. Visnu [2] was another god; he said, &lsquo;Visnu, come hither; we will grasp that by which he is this world. Visnu deposited himself in three places, a third on the earth, a third in the atmosphere, a third in the sky, for he was afraid of his growth. By means of the third on earth Indra raised his bolt, aided by Visnu. He said, &lsquo;Hurl it not at me; there is this [3] strength in me; I will give it to you.&rsquo; He gave it to him, he accepted it, and (saying), &lsquo;Thou didst further me&rsquo;, gave it to Visnu. Visnu accepted it (saying), &lsquo;Let Indra place power (indriya) in us.&rsquo; By means of the third in the atmosphere Indra raised his bolt, aided by Visnu. He said, &lsquo;Hurl it not at me; there is this [4] strength in me; I will give it to you.&rsquo; He gave it to him; he accepted it, and (saying), &lsquo;Twice hast thou furthered me&rsquo;, gave it to Visnu. Visnu accepted it (saying), &lsquo;Let Indra place power in us.&rsquo; By means of the third in the sky Indra raised his bolt, aided by Visnu. He said, &lsquo;Hurl it not at me; I will give to thee that by which I [5] am this world! He said, &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; (He replied), &lsquo;Let us make a compact; let me enter thee.&rsquo; &lsquo;If thou dost enter me, in what way wilt thou enjoy me?&rsquo; &lsquo;I will kindle thee; I will enter thee for thine enjoyment&rsquo;, he answered. Vrtra entered him. Vrtra is the belly; hunger is man&rsquo;s enemy; he who [6] knows this slays the enemy hunger. He gave it to him; he accepted it, and (saying), &lsquo;Thrice hast thou furthered me&rsquo;, gave it to Visnu. Visnu accepted it (saying), &lsquo;Let Indra place power in us.&rsquo; In that thrice he gave and thrice he accepted, that is the reason of the threefold character of the threefold. In that Visnu aided him and he gave (it) to Visnu, therefore the offering belongs to Indra and Visnu. Whatever there is here he gave to him, the Rces, the Samans, the Yajuses. A thousand he gave to him; therefore there are a thousand gifts.</p>

<p>The gods were afraid of the warrior on his birth. While still within (the womb) they fettered him with a bond. The warrior thus is born fettered; if he were born not fettered he would continually slay his foes. If one desire of a warrior, &lsquo;May he be born not fettered, may he continually slay his foes&rsquo;, one should offer for him the offering for Indra and Brhaspati, for the warrior is connected with Indra, Brhaspati is the holy power (Brahman); verily by the holy power (Brahman) he frees him from the bond that fetters him.

<p>Viśvarupa, son of Tvastr, was the domestic priest of the gods, and the sister&rsquo;s son of the Asuras. He had three heads, one which drank Soma, one Sura, and one which ate food. He promised openly the share to the gods, secretly to the Asuras. Men promise openly the share to every one; if they promise any one secretly, his share is indeed promised. Therefore Indra was afraid (thinking), &lsquo;Such an one is diverting the sovereignty (from me).&rsquo; He took his bolt and smote off his heads. (The head) which drank Soma [1] became a hazelcock; (the head) which drank Sura a sparrow; (the head) which ate food a partridge. He seized with his hand the guilt of slaying him, and bore it for a year. Creatures called out upon him, &lsquo;Thou art a Brahman slayer.&rsquo; He appealed to the earth, &lsquo;Take a third part of my guilt.&rsquo; She said, &lsquo;Let me choose a boon. I deem that I shall be overcome through digging. Let me not be overcome by that.&rsquo; He replied, &lsquo;Before [2] a year is out it will grow up for thee.&rsquo; Therefore before the year is out the dug-out portion of earth grows up again, for that was what she chose as a boon. She took a third of his guilt. That became a natural fissure; therefore one who has</p>
<p>piled up a fire-altar and whose deity is faith should not choose a natural fissure, for that is the colour of guilt. He appealed to the trees, &lsquo;Take a third part of my guilt.&rsquo; They said, &lsquo;Let us choose a boon. We deem that we shall be overcome through pruning [3]. Let us not be overcome by that.&rsquo; He replied, &lsquo;From pruning shall more (shoots) spring up for you.&rsquo; Therefore from the pruning of trees more (shoots) spring up, for that was what they chose as a boon. They took a third part of his guilt, it became sap; therefore one should not partake of sap, for it is the colour of guilt. Or rather of the sap which is red or which comes from the pruning one should not partake [4], but of other sap at will. He appealed to a concourse of women, &lsquo;Take the third of my guilt.&rsquo; They said, &lsquo;Let us choose a boon; let us obtain offspring from after the menses; let us enjoy intercourse at will up to birth.&rsquo; Therefore women obtain offspring from after the menses, and enjoy intercourse at will up to birth, for that was what they chose as a boon. They took a third of his guilt, it became (a woman) with stained garments; therefore one should not converse with (a woman) with stained garments [5], one should not sit with her, nor eat her food, for she keeps emitting the colour of guilt. Or rather they say, &lsquo;Woman&rsquo;s food is unguent, and there fore one should not accept (from her) unguent, but anything else (can be accepted) at will.&rsquo; The son born of intercourse with (a woman) with stained garments is accursed; (the son born) of intercourse in the forest is a thief; (the son born) of intercourse with a (woman) who turns away is shamefaced and retiring; (the son born) of intercourse with a woman bathing is fated to drown; (the son born) of one who [6] anoints herself has a skin disease; (the son born) of one who combs her hair is bald and feeble; (the son born) of one who anoints (her eyes) is blind; (the son born) of one who cleans her teeth has dirty teeth; (the son born) of one who cuts her nails has bad nails; (the son born) of one who spins is a eunuch; (the son born) of one who weaves ropes is unrestrained; (the son born) of one who drinks from a leaf is drunken; (the son born) of one who drinks from a mutilated (vessel) is mutilated. For three nights he should keep a vow and should drink from his hand or from a perfect vessel, to guard his offspring.</p>

<p>Tvastr, his son being slain, offered Soma excluding Indra. Indra desired an invitation to the rite, but he did not invite him; (saying) &lsquo;Thou hast slain my son.&rsquo; He made a disturbance of the sacrifice, and forcibly drank the Soma. The remains of it Tvastr cast upon the Ahavaniya (fire), (saying), &lsquo;Hail! wax great, Indra&rsquo;s foe.&rsquo; In that he cast it (avartayat), Vrtra is Vrtra; in that he said, &lsquo;Hail! wax great, Indra&rsquo;s foe&rsquo;, therefore [1] Indra became his foe. He sprang into life and came into union with Agni and Soma. He grew on all sides an arrow(shot), he enveloped these worlds. Because he enveloped these worlds, therefore is Vrtra, Vrtra. Indra feared him. He ran up to Prajapati, (saying), &lsquo;A foe has sprung up for me.&rsquo; He dipped his bolt and gave it to him, (saying), &lsquo;Slay with it.&rsquo; He went against (him) with it. Agni and Soma said, &lsquo;Hurl it not [2]; we are within.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ye are mine&rsquo;, he replied, &lsquo;come to me.&rsquo; They asked for a share; he gave them at the full moon this offering for Agni and Soma on eleven potsherds. They said, &lsquo;We are bitten all round, and cannot come.&rsquo; Indra produced from himself cold and fever heat; that was the origin of cold and fever heat. Him who knows thus the origin of cold and fever heat [3] neither cold nor fever heat slays. By them he led him on, and as he gaped Agni and Soma went forth from him. Then expiration and inspiration deserted him; skill is expiration, intelligence is inspiration; therefore one who gapes should say, &lsquo;Skill and intelligence (remain) in me&rsquo;; verily he places expiration and inspiration in himself and lives all his days. He, having called off the gods from. Vrtra offered at the full moon the oblation to the Vrtra slayer; they slay him at the full moon [4], but make him swell at the new moon; therefore verses are uttered at the full moon referring to the slaying of Vrtra, at the new moon referring to his increase. Having performed the oblation to the Vrtra slayer, he took his bolt and again went against (him). Sky and earth said, &lsquo;Hurl it not; he rests in us two.&rsquo; They said, &lsquo;Let us choose a boon.&rsquo; &lsquo;May I be adorned with the Naksatras&rsquo;, said yonder (sky); I May I be adorned with variegated things&rsquo;, said this (earth). Therefore yonder (sky) is adorned with the Naksatras, this (earth) with variegated things. He who knows thus the boon of sky and earth [5] attains a boon. Indra thus impelled by these two slew Vrtra. The gods having slain Vrtra said to Agni and Soma, &lsquo;Bear the offering for us.&rsquo; They said, &lsquo;We two have lost our brilliance, our brilliance is in Vrtra.&rsquo; They said, &lsquo;Who is there to go for it?&rsquo; &lsquo;The cow&rsquo;, they said, &lsquo;The cow is the friend of all.&rsquo; She said [6], &lsquo;Let me choose a boon; ye shall feed off both when they are in me.&rsquo; The cow brought the (brilliance); therefore they feed off both things that</p>
<p>are in the cow; ghee indeed is the brilliance of Agni, milk the brilliance of Soma. He who knows thus the brilliance of Agni and Soma becomes brilliant. The theologians say, &lsquo;What is the deity of the full moon (rite)?&rsquo; He should reply, &lsquo;Prajapati; by means of it he established his eldest son, Indra.&rsquo; Therefore they establish their eldest sons with wealth.</p>
<h4 id="03-12">03</h4>
<p>When Indra had slain Vrtra, his enemies threatened him. He saw this enemy-dispelling (oblation) to be offered subsequently at the full moon. He offered it, and with it drove away his enemies. In that the enemy-dispelling (oblation) is to be offered subsequently at the full moon, the sacrificer by it drives away his enemies. Indra, having slain Vrtra, lost the gods and his power. He saw the (offering) to Agni on eight potsherds at the new moon, and the curds for Indra [1]. He offered it, and by it he won the gods and his power. In that at the new moon there is (an offering) to Agni on eight potsherds, and curds for Indra, the sacrificer wins by it the gods and power. When Indra had slain Vrtra, his power and strength went into the earth; then the plants and roots were born. He ran up to Prajapati, (saying), &lsquo;Now that I have slain Vrtra, my power and strength [2] have gone into the earth; then the plants and roots have been born.&rsquo; Prajapati said to cattle, &lsquo;Collect it for him.&rsquo; The cattle collected it from the plants in themselves; they milked it. In that they collected it, has the collected oblation (sammayya) its name; in that they milked it, has fresh milk its name (pratidhuk). &lsquo;They have collected it; they have milked it; but it rests not in me&rsquo;, he said. &lsquo;Make it ready for him&rsquo; [3], he replied. They made it ready for him; they made power and strength rest in him; verily the ready (milk) has its name (śrta). &lsquo;They have collected it; they have milked it; they have made it ready; but it does not impel me&rsquo;, he said. &lsquo;Make it curds for him&rsquo;, he replied. They made it curds for him; that impelled (ahinot) him; verily curds (dadhi) has its name. The theologians say, &lsquo;One should offer curds first, for curds is made first&rsquo; [4]. One should disregard that and offer ready (milk) first; verily one places power and strength in him and later impels him by curds; and he proceeds in order (of production). If he curdles it with Putika plants or with bark, that is fit for Soma; if with jujubes, that is for the Raksases; if with rice grains, for the All-gods; if with rennet, for men; if with curds, that has Indra. He curdles it with curds [5] that it may have Indra. He curdles the remains of the Agnihotra, for the continuity of the sacrifice. Indra having slain Vrtra went to a great distance, thinking, &lsquo;I have sinned.&rsquo; The gods sought to start him. Prajapati said, I He who first finds him will have the first share.&rsquo; The Pitrs found him; therefore an offering is made to the Pitrs on the day before. He approached the new moon night; the gods met him, (saying), &lsquo;Our treasure to-day at home [6] dwells&rsquo;, for Indra is the treasure of the gods, and that is why the new moon night has its name (ama-vasya), &lsquo;home dwelling&rsquo;). The theologians say, What is the deity of the Samnayya?&rsquo; &lsquo;The All-gods&rsquo;, he should reply, for so the All-gods won that as their share.' Or rather he should reply, &lsquo;Indra, for it was in healing Indra that they won it.&rsquo;</p>
<h4 id="04-12">04</h4>
<p>The theologians say, &lsquo;He would indeed offer the new and full moon (sacrifices) who should offer them with Indra.&rsquo; At the full moon there is the subsequent offering of the enemy-dispelling (oblation), and by it the full moon has Indra. There are curds for Indra at the new moon; verily the new moon has Indra. He who knowing thus offers,' the new and full moon sacrifices, offers them with Indra, and day after day it becomes better for him who has so sacrificed. What the gods did at the sacrifice, the Asuras did. The gods [1] saw this offering, one on eleven potsherds for Agni and Visnu, an oblation for Sarasvati, an oblation for Sarasvant; after performing the full moon (sacrifice) they offered this. Then the gods prospered, the Asuras were defeated. He who has enemies should offer this offering after performing the full moon (sacrifice). With the full moon (sacrifice) he hurls the bolt at his enemy, with (the offering) to Agni and Visnu he appropriates the gods and the sacrifice of his enemy, his pairing cattle with (the offerings) to Sarasvati and Sarasvant. Whatever he has, all that [2] he appropriates. One should sacrifice at the full moon, if one has enemies, not at the new moon; having slain one&rsquo;s enemy one does not cause him to grow again. He who desires cattle should sacrifice with the Sakamprasthayiya. The man to whom they bring (any thing) in small measure is not himself pleased, and does not give to another. But he, to</p>
<p>whom they bring in large measure, is himself pleased, and gives to another. One should offer in full and large measure; Indra then being pleased delights him with offspring and cattle. He offers with a wooden vessel, for an earthenware one does not hold the offering. It is of Udumbara wood [3]; the Udumbara is strength, cattle are strength; verily by strength he wins for him strength and cattle. One should not sacrifice to, Mahendra, if one is not prosperous. The prosperous are three; a learned (Brahman), a village headman, and a warrior. Their deity is Mahendra. He who sacrifices beyond his own deity loses his own deity, and does not obtain another, and becomes worse. For a year one should sacrifice to Indra, for the vow extends not beyond the year; verily [4] his own deity, being sacrificed to, kindles him with prosperity and he becomes richer. After the year he should offer a cake on eight potsherds to Agni, lord of vows; verily for a year Agni, lord of vows, causes him to take up the vow who has slain his foe (vrtra). Thereafter he may sacrifice at will.</p>

<p>No one who is not a Soma sacrificer should offer the Samnayya. For the milk of him who is not a Soma sacrificer is imperfect, and if one who is not a Soma sacrificer offers the Samnayya he is a thief and does wrong, and (his milk) is poured forth in vain. A Soma sacrificer only should offer the Samnayya. Soma is milk, the Samnayya is milk; verily with milk he places milk in himself. The moon deprives him of offspring and cattle, and makes his enemy wax great on whose sacrifice when offered it rises in the east [1]. He should divide the rice grains into three parts; the mean size he should make into a cake on eight potsherds for Agni, the giver, the largest lie should give as a mess to Indra, the bestower, the smallest (he should give) as a mess in boiled (milk) to Visnu Çipivista. Agni thus generates offspring for him; Indra gives it in crease; Visnu is the sacrifice, and Çipi cattle; verily on the sacrifice and cattle he rests. He should not offer twice [2]. If he were to offer now with the first he would make a failure with the second; if with the second now, he would make a failure with the first; there is no offering at all and no sacrifice, for that cause a son is born shamefaced and retiring. One offering only should one make; a valiant son is born to him. One should disregard this and offer twice. With the first (offering) one grasps the mouth of the sacrifice, and sacrifices with the second. Verily one wins the gods with the first, power with the second; verily one conquers the world of the gods [3] with the first; the world of men with the second; he performs several forms of sacrifice. This offering is called &lsquo;the friendly&rsquo;; for him there is in this world prosperity on whom the moon rises in the west after he hag sacrificed on that day. He who desires heaven should sacrifice with the Daksayana sacrifice. On the full moon he should offer the Samnayya; on the new moon he should sacrifice with clotted curds for Mitra and Varuna. On the full moon (the Soma) is pressed for the gods; during this half-month it is pressed forth for them, and a cow for Mitra and Varuna is to be slaughtered for them at the new moon. In that [4] he sacrifices on the day before, he makes the sacrificial enclosure. In that he drives away the calves, he metes out the seat and the oblation holder. In that he sacrifices, he produces with the gods the pressing day. He drinks for the half-month Soma in carouse with the gods. In that he sacrifices at the new moon with clotted curds for Mitra and Varuna, the cow which is slaughtered for the gods becomes his also. He mounts upon the gods in truth who mounts upon their sacrifice [5]. Just as a great man who has attained (fortune) desires (and does), so he does. If he misses the mark he becomes worse; if he does not, he remains the same. One who desires distinction should sacrifice with it, for this sacrifice has a razor edge, and swiftly he becomes holy or perishes. His vow is: he shall not speak untruth; be shall not eat meat; he shall not approach for all a woman; they shall not clean his raiment with cleansing stuff; for all these things the gods do not do.</p>

<p>The new and the full moon (sacrifices) are the chariot of the gods. He, who having offered the new and the full moon (sacrifices) Sacrifices with Soma, rests in the chosen resting-place of the gods which is conspicuous for its chariot (tracks). The new and the full moons are the limbs and joints of the year; he who knowing thus offers the new and the full moon (sacrifices) thus unites the limbs and joints of the year. The new and the full moon are the eyes of the year; he who knowing thus offers the new and the full moon (sacrifices) thus sees with them along the world of heaven [1]. The</p>
<p>which the gods fare. The new and the full moons are the bay steeds of the gods; he who knowing thus offers the new and the full moon (sacrifices) carries to the gods with their two bay steeds [2] the offering. The new and the full moon (sacrifices) are the mouth of the gods; he who knowing thus offers the new and the full moon (sacrifices) manifestly sacrifices in the mouth of the gods. He who offers the new and the full moon sacrifices possesses an oblation holder. He offers the Agnihotra morn and evening, he offers the new and the full moon (sacrifices); on every day (the Soma) of those who have oblation holders is pressed. By him who knowing thus offers the new and the full moon (sacrifices) regarding himself as possessiug an oblation holder, everything is given as on the strew. The gods [3] could not find the suitable day for the sacrifice. They purified the new and full moons; the new and the full moon (sacrifices) are these pure and sacrificial (days). He who knowing thus offers the new and the full moon (sacrifices) offers them as pure and sacrificial. One should not approach a woman on the new moon or the full moon night; if one were to do so, one would be impotent. The nights of the half-month were the wives of King Soma; of these be did not approach the new moon night and the full moon night [4]. They grasped him about, and illness seized him. &lsquo;Illness has seized the king&rsquo;; that (saying) is the origin of the &lsquo;king&rsquo;s evil &lsquo;. In that he became worse, that is (the origin) of the &lsquo;bad illness&rsquo;; because he got it from his wives, that is (the origin) of the &lsquo;wife&rsquo;s disease&rsquo; (Jayenya), him who knows thus the origin of these illnesses, these illnesses do not visit. He ran up to these two in reverence; they said, &lsquo;Let us choose a boon; let us be the appointers of portions for the gods [5]; from us let the gods be sacrificed to.&rsquo; Therefore of the series of nights it is on the new and the full moon night that the gods are sacrificed to; for they are the appointers of portions for the gods. Men appoint portions to him who knows thus. Creatures slew hunger, man at once, the gods at the half-month, the Pitrs in a month, trees in a year. Therefore day by day men desire food, at the half-month the gods are sacrificed to, every month offering is made to the Pitrs, in a year trees produce fruit. He who knows thus slays the enemy, hunger.<br>

<p>The gods could not rest on the Rc or the Yajus. On the Saman only could they rest. He makes the noise &lsquo;Him&rsquo;; verily he makes the Saman. He makes the noise &lsquo;Him&rsquo;; where the gods rested, there he sets them in motion. He makes the noise &lsquo;Him&rsquo;; this is the yoking of speech. He makes the noise &lsquo;Him&rsquo;; thus the sacrificers produce offspring. He repeats the first (verse) thrice, the last thrice; verily he ties the end of the sacrifice [1] so that it may not slip. He repeats (it) continuously, for the continuity of the breaths and of food, and for the smiting away of the Raksases. The first he repeats is connected with the Rathantara (Saman), this world is connected with the Rathantara; verily he conquers this world. He divides it thrice; these worlds are three; verily he conquers these worlds. The last he repeats is connected with the Brhat (Saman); yonder world is connected with the Brhat; verily he conquers yonder world. &lsquo;Forward [2] your viands&rsquo;, he repeats, a verse which has not any indication (of its deity) and (therefore) is addressed to Prajapati. Prajapati is the sacrifice; verily he grasps the sacrifice as Prajapati. &lsquo;Forward your viands&rsquo;, he repeats; viands are food; verily he wins food. &lsquo;Forward your viands&rsquo;, he repeats; therefore seed is deposited in front. &lsquo;O Agni, come hither for the feast&rsquo;, he repeats; therefore offspring are born at the back. &lsquo;Forward your viands&rsquo;, he repeats [3]; &lsquo;viands&rsquo; are the months, &lsquo;heavenwards&rsquo; are the half-months, &lsquo;rich in the oblation&rsquo; are the gods, &lsquo;full of butter&rsquo; is the cow, &lsquo;he goes to the gods&rsquo; (that is) the sacrifice, &lsquo;desirous of favour ' is the sacrificer. &lsquo;Thou art this, thou art this&rsquo;, (with these words) he wins the dear abode of the sacrifice. If he desire for a man, &lsquo;May he live all his days&rsquo;, he should repeat for him &lsquo;Forward your viands&rsquo;, and then continuously the next half-verse of &lsquo;Agni, come hither to the feast&rsquo; [4]. Verily by expiration does he make steadfast his inspiration, and he lives all his days. He, who knows the elbow of the Samidhenis, puts his enemy in his elbow. He joins the half-verses; this is the elbow of the Samidhenis; he who knows thus puts his foe in his elbow. The Samidhenis were brought out by Rsi after Rsi; if they were not connected together, they would go away from the sacrificer&rsquo;s offspring</p>
<p>and cattle. He unites the half-verses; verily he connects them together, and being so connected and secured they yield him all his desires.</p>
<h4 id="08-12">08</h4>
<p>Without a Saman there is no sacrifice. &lsquo;O Agni, come hither for the feast&rsquo;, he says; this is the character of the Rathantara. &lsquo;Thee with the kindling-sticks, O Angiras&rsquo;, he says; this is the character of the Vamadevya. &lsquo;The great and powerful one, O Agni&rsquo;, he says. This is the character of the Brhat. In that he repeats this Trca, he makes the sacrifice have Samans. Agni was in yonder world, the sun in this; these worlds were disturbed [1]. The gods said, &lsquo;Let us change them about.&rsquo; (Saying), &lsquo;O Agni, come hither for the feast&rsquo;, they placed Agni in this world, and (saying),&lsquo;The great and powerful one, O Agni&rsquo;, they placed the sun in yonder world. Then indeed these worlds became calm. In that he repeats (it) thus, (it serves) for the calming of these worlds; these worlds become calm for him who knows thus. He repeats fifteen Samidhenis [2]. The nights of the half-month are fifteen; the year is made up of half-months. There are three hundred and sixty syllables in the Samidhenis; there are as many nights in the year; verily by syllables he obtains the year. Nrmedha and Paruchepa had a theological dispute (and said), &lsquo;Let us generate fire in the dry wood (to see) which of us two is the more of a theologian.&rsquo; Nrmedha spoke; he generated smoke. Paruchepa spoke; he generated fire. &lsquo;O Rsi&rsquo;, he said, [3], &lsquo;seeing that our knowledge is equal, how didst thou generate fire and not I?&rsquo; &lsquo;I know the character of the Samidhenis&rsquo;, he replied. The character of the Samidhenis is the quarter-verse which is repeated with the word &lsquo;ghee&rsquo; in it. &lsquo;Thee with the kindling sticks, Angiras&rsquo;, he says; verily he generates light in the Samidhenis. They are feminine in that they are Rc (verses), they are feminine in that they are Gayatri (verses), they are feminine in that they are Samidhenis. He repeats a verse with the word &lsquo;Male&rsquo; in it [4]. By it he gives them a husband, makes them possess Indra, and mates them. Agni was the messenger of the gods, Uśanas Kavya of the Asuras. They went to question Prajapati; he turned away (from Uśanas) (with the words). &lsquo;Agni as messenger we choose.&rsquo; Then the gods prospered, the Asuras were defeated. The man for whom, knowing thus, he repeats, &lsquo;Agni as messenger we choose, prospers himself, his enemy is defeated. He repeats a verse with the word &lsquo;imperishable&rsquo;; verily by it he causes his enemy to perish [5]. &lsquo;The flaming locked, him we adore&rsquo;, he says; that is purifying; verily with it he makes pure the sacrificer. &lsquo;Thou art lit, O Agni, worshipped&rsquo;, he says; verily he places around a barrier that may not be climbed. If he were to add anything further, it would be just as when (a libation) falls outside the barriers. There are three Agnis, the oblation bearer of the gods, the bearer of the offering of the Pitrs, the guardian of the Asuras. They repeat, &lsquo;Me will he choose, me&rsquo; [6]. &lsquo;Choose ye the bearer of the oblation&rsquo;, he says; &lsquo;let him choose him who is of the gods. He chooses one of a Rsi&rsquo;s family; verily he departs not from the connexion, (and so it serves) for continuity. He chooses, beginning at the further end, in order of descent; therefore the Pitrs drink after men in order of descent, beginning at the further end.</p>

<p>&lsquo;O Agni, thou art great&rsquo;, he says, for Agni is great. &lsquo;O Brahman&rsquo;, he says, for he is a Brahman. &lsquo;O Bharata&rsquo;,&rsquo; he says, for he bears the sacrifice to the gods. &lsquo;Kindled by the gods&rsquo;, he says, for the gods kindled him. &lsquo;Kindled by Manu&rsquo;, he says, for Manu kindled him after the gods. &lsquo;Praised by the Rsis&rsquo;, he says, for the Rsis praised him. &lsquo;Rejoiced in by sages&rsquo;, he says [1], for learned people are sages. &lsquo;Celebrated by the poets&rsquo;, he says, for learned people are the poets. &lsquo;Quickened by the holy power (Brahman)&rsquo;, he says, for he is quickened by the holy power (Brahman). &lsquo;With ghee offering&rsquo;, he says, for ghee is his dearest offering. &lsquo;Leader of the sacrifices&rsquo;, he says, for he is the leader of the sacrifices. &lsquo;Charioteer of the rites&rsquo;, he says, for he is the chariot of the gods. &lsquo;The Hotr unsurpassed&rsquo;, he says, for no one surpasses him [2]. &lsquo;Surpassing, bearing the oblation&rsquo;, he says, for he surpasses all. &lsquo;The mouth dish, the ladle of the gods&rsquo;, he says, for he is the ladle of the gods. &lsquo;The bowl from which the gods drink&rsquo;, he says, for he is the bowl from which the gods drink. &lsquo;O Agni, like a felly the spokes, thou dost surround the gods&rsquo;, he says, for he surrounds the gods. If he were to say, &lsquo;Bring hither the gods to the pious sacrificer&rsquo;, he would produce an enemy for him [3].2 &lsquo;Bring hither the gods to the sacrificer&rsquo;, he says; verily with that be makes the sacrificer to grow great. &lsquo;O</p>
<p>Agni, bring Agni hither, bring Soma hither&rsquo;, he says; verily he summons the gods in order. &lsquo;Bring hither the gods, O Agni; and sacrifice to them with a fair sacrifice, O Jatavedas&rsquo;, he says; verily he quickens Agni, and quickened by him he bears the oblation to the gods. &lsquo;Agni the Hotr&rsquo; [4], he says; Agni is the Hotr of the gods; him he chooses who is the Hotr of the gods. &lsquo;We are&rsquo;, he says; verily he makes himself attain reality. &lsquo;Fair be to thee the deity, O sacrificer&rsquo;, he says; verily he invokes this blessing (on him). If he were to say &lsquo;Who hast chosen Agni as Hotr&rsquo;, he would surround the sacrificer with Agni on both sides, and he would be liable to perish. The ladle has the sacrificer for its deity, the Upabhrt the enemy as its deity [5]. If he were to say two as it were, he would produce an enemy for him. &lsquo;Take, Adhvaryu, the spoon (sruc) with ghee&rsquo;, he says; verily by it he causes the sacrificer to wax great. &lsquo;Pious&rsquo;, he says, for he aids the gods, &lsquo;With all boons&rsquo;, he says, for he aids all. &lsquo;Let us praise the gods worthy of praise; let us honour those worthy of honour; let us sacrifice to those worthy of sacrifice&rsquo;, he says. Those worthy of praise are men; those worthy of honour are the Pitrs; those worthy of sacrifice are the gods; verily he sacrifices to the deities according to their portions.</p>
<h4 id="10-11">10</h4>
<p>In the case of a Rajanya let him repeat the Trcas thrice three other sorts of men are there besides the warrior, the Brahman, Vaiśya and Çudra; verily he makes them obedient to him. He should repeat fifteen (Samidhenis) in the case of a Rajanya; the Rajanya is fifteenfold; verily he makes him find support in his own Stoma. Let him surround it with a Tristubh; the Tristubh is power, the Rajanya sacrifices in desire of power; verily by the Tristubh he secures power for him. If he desires [1], &lsquo;May there be splendour&rsquo;, he should surround it with a Gayatri, the Gayatri is splendour; verily there is splendour. He should repeat seventeen for a Vaiśya; the Vaiśya is seventeenfold; verily he makes him find support in his own Stoma. He should surround it with a Jagati; cattle are connected with the Jagati, the Vaiśya sacrifices in desire of cattle; verily by the Jagati he secures cattle for him. He should repeat twenty one for one who desires support; the Ekavinśa is the support of the Stomas; (verily twenty-one serve) for support [2]. He should repeat twenty-four for one who desires splendour: the Gayatri has twenty-four syllables, splendour is the Gayatri; verily by the Gayatri he secures splendour for him. He should repeat thirty for one who desires food; the Viraj has thirty syllables, the Viraj is food; verily by the Viraj he secures food for him. He should repeat thirty-two, for one who desires support; the Anustubh has thirty-two syllables, the Anustubh is the support of the metres; (verily thirty-two serve) for support. He should repeat thirty-six for one who desires cattle; the Brhati has thirty-six syllables, cattle are connected with the Brhati; verily by the Brhati he secures cattle for him [3]. He should repeat forty-four for one who desires power, the Tristubh has forty-four syllables, the Tristubh is power; verily by the Tristubh he secures power for him. He should repeat forty-eight for one who desires cattle; the Jagati has forty-eight syllables, cattle are connected with the Jagati; verily with the Jagati he secures cattle for him. He should repeat all the metres for one who makes many sacrifices, for all the metres are won by him who makes many sacrifices. He should repeat indefinitely to win that which is not definite.</p>
<h4 id="11-12">11</h4>
<p>The thread is worn around the neck for men, over the right shoulder for the Pitrs, over the left for the gods. He puts it over the left shoulder; verily he makes the mark of the gods. He repeats standing, for standing he speaks more audibly. He repeats standing, to conquer the world of heaven. He sacrifices sitting; verily he finds support in this world. In that he repeats in the Krauñca, note, that is connected with the Asuras, in the low note, that is connected with men, in the intermediate note, that is connected with the gods. One should repeat in the intermediate note, to secure the gods. Clever indeed [1] were the Hotrs of old; there fore the ways were held apart, and the paths did not conflict. One foot should be within the sacrificial altar, the other outside; then he repeats, to hold the ways apart and to avoid conflict of the paths. Then does he win the past and the future, the measured and the unmeasured does he win, domestic and wild cattle both does he win [2]; verily also the world of the gods and the world of men he conquers.</p>
<p>The gods having repeated the Samidhenis could not see the sacrifice. Prajapati in silence performed the sprinkling of the butter. Then indeed did the gods see the sacrifice. In that he silently sprinkles, (it serves) to light up the sacrifice. Verily also he anoints the kindling-sticks. He who knows thus becomes soft. Verily also he delights them. He delights in offspring and cattle [3] who knows thus. If he were to sprinkle with one (verse), he would delight one; if with two, (he would delight) two; if with three, he would make (the offering) go beyond (all others). He sprinkles (repeating the verse) in the mind, for what is imperfect is made perfect by mind. He sprinkles across so as not to make a failure. Speech and mind disputed; &lsquo;I will bear the offering to the gods&rsquo;, speech said; &lsquo;I to the gods&rsquo;, mind said. They went to question Prajapati; he said [4], Prajapati, &lsquo;Thou art the messenger of mind, for what one thinks of in the mind, one utters in speech&rsquo;. &lsquo;Then assuredly they will not sacrifice to you with speech&rsquo;, said (speech). Therefore in the mind they offer to Prajapati, for Prajapati is, as it were, the mind; (verily it serves) to obtain Prajapati. He rubs the enclosing-sticks; verily he purifies them. (He rubs) the middle one thrice; the breaths are three; verily he conquers the breaths. (He rubs) the southern one thrice; these worlds are three [5]; verily he conquers these worlds. (He rubs) the northern one thrice; three are the paths leading to the gods; verily he conquers them. Thrice he fans (the fire); the worlds of the gods are three; verily he conquers the worlds of the gods. They make twelve; the year has twelve months; verily he delights the year; verily also he brings up the year for him, to gain the world of heaven. He sprinkles; the world of heaven is as it were secret [6]; verily he makes the world of heaven resplendent for him. He sprinkles straight, for the breath is as it were straight. He sprinkles continuously, for the continuity of the breaths and of food and for the smiting away of the Raksases. If he desire of a man, &lsquo;May he be likely to perish&rsquo;, he should sprinkle crookedly for him; verily he leads his breath crookedly from him, and swiftly he perishes. The sprinkling is the head of the sacrifice, the ladle is the body [7]. Having sprinkled, he anoints the ladle; verily he places the head of the sacrifice on its body. Agni was the messenger of the gods, Daivya of the Asuras; they went to question Prajapati. Prajapati spake to a Brahman (saying), &lsquo;Explain the phrase, &ldquo;Make announcement&rdquo;&rsquo;, &lsquo;Hearken to this, O ye gods&rsquo;, he said; &lsquo;Agni the god is the Hotr&rsquo;, (he said). He chose him of the gods. Then the gods [8] prospered, the Asuras were defeated. The man, who knows thus and for whom they chose his list of ancestors, prospers himself, his enemy is defeated. If a Brahman and a non-Brahman have a litigation, one should support the Brahman; if one supports the Brahman, one supports oneself; if one opposes the Brahman, one opposes oneself therefore one should not oppose a Brahman.</p>

He offers with the cry of &lsquo;Hail!'; verily he finds support in the world of heaven. So many are the worlds of the gods; verily in them in order he finds support. The gods and the Asuras contended as to these worlds. The gods by the fore-sacrifices drove the Asuras away from these worlds; that is why the fore-sacrifices [3] are so called. He for whom knowing thus are offered the fore-sacrifices, drives his enemy away from these worlds. He offers stepping near, for conquest.

He offers to the kindling-sticks as many, to the sacrificial strew as one, and that makes a pair. That is the pairing of the fore-sacrifices. He who knows thus [4] is propagated with offspring, with cattle, with pairings. These deities were not sacrificed to by the gods; then the Asuras were fain to harm the sacrifice. The gods divided the Gayatri, five syllables in front and three behind. Then the sacrifice was protected, and the sacrificer. In that the fore- and after sacrifices are offered, protection is afforded to the sacrifice and to the sacrificer, for the overcoming of the enemy. Therefore a covering is larger in front and smaller behind. The gods thought that the sacrifice must be completed (in the fore-sacrifice) before the Raksases [5] with the cry of &lsquo;Hail!&rsquo; They completed it with the cry of &lsquo;Hail!&rsquo; in the fore-sacrifices. They split the sacrifice who complete it with the cry of &lsquo;Hail!&rsquo; in the fore-sacrifices. Having offered the fore sacrifices he sprinkles the oblations, for the continuity of the sacrifice; then verily he makes the oblation, and then he proceeds in order. The fore-sacrifices are the father, the after-sacrifices the son; in that having offered the fore-sacrifices he sprinkles the oblations, the father makes common property with the son [6]. Therefore they say, who know it or who know not, &lsquo;How is it the son&rsquo;s only, how is the father&rsquo;s common?&rsquo; That which spills when the fore-sacrifices are offered is not really spilt. The Gayatri conceives through it, and produces offspring and cattle for the sacrificer.</p>
<h4 id="02-12">02</h4>
<p>The two portions of the oblation are the eyes of the sacrifice. In that he offers the two portions of the oblation, he inserts the two eyes of the sacrifice. He offers in the front place; therefore the eyes are in front. He offers evenly; therefore the eyes are even. By Agni the sacrificer discerns the world of the gods, by Soma the world of the Pitrs; in the north part he offers to Agni, in the south to Soma, for these worlds are thus, as it were, to illumine these worlds. Agni and Soma are the kings of the gods [1]. They are sacrificed to between the gods, to separate the gods. Therefore men are separated by the king. The theologians say, &lsquo;What is it that the sacrificer does in the sacrifice to support both those animals which have incisors on one side only and those which have incisors on both?&rsquo; When he has repeated a Rc, he makes an offering of the portion of the oblation with the jusana formula; by that means he supports those with incisors on one side only. When he has repeated a Rc, he makes an offering of the sacrificial food (havis) with a Rc; by that means he supports those with incisors on both sides. The Puronuvakya contains the word &lsquo;head&rsquo;; verily he makes him head of his peers [2]. He offers with averse containing the word &lsquo;team&rsquo; (niyut); verily he appropriates (ni-yu) the cattle of his enemy. Keśin Satyakami said to Keśin Darbhya, &lsquo;The seven-footed Çakvari I shall use for thee at the sacrifice to-morrow, by whose strength one defeats the enemies that have arisen and those that shall be, by the first half of whose strength the ox feeds, by the second half the cow.&rsquo; The Puronuvakya is marked in front; verily he defeats the enemies that have arisen; the Yajya is marked</p>
<p>behind [3]; verily he defeats the enemies that shall be. The Puronuvakya is marked in front; verily he places light in this world; the Yajya is marked behind; verily he places light in yonder world. Full of light become these worlds to him who knows thus. The Puronuvakya, is marked in front; therefore the ox feeds with the first half. The Yajya is marked behind; therefore the cow feeds with the second half. Him who knows thus these two enjoy. The oblation is a bolt, the portions of the oblation are a bolt [4], the Vasat call is a bolt; thus forges be a threefold bolt and hurls it at his foe, so as not to make a failure. He utters the Vasat call in anger, to lay low his foe. The Puronuvakya is the Gayatri, the Yajya the Tristubh; verily he makes the ruling class dependent on the priestly class; therefore the Brahman is the chief. The chief he becomes who knows thus. He proclaims him with the Puronuvakya, leads him forward with the Yajya, and makes him go with the Vasat call. He takes him with the Puronuvakya, he gives him with the Yajya, and [5] establishes him with the Vasat call. The Puronuvakya has three feet; these worlds are three; verily he finds support in these worlds. The Yajya has four feet; verily he wins four footed cattle. The Vasat call has two syllables, the sacrificer has two feet; verily afterwards he finds support in cattle. The Puronuvakya is the Gayatri, the Yajya, the Tristubh, and this is the sevenfooted Çakvari. Whatever the gods were fain to do by it, that they were able to do; he who knows thus can do whatever he is fain to do.</p>
<h4 id="03-13">03</h4>
<p>Prajapati assigned the sacrifices to the gods. He placed in himself the oblation. The gods said to him, &lsquo;The oblation is the sacrifice; let us have a share in it.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;Lot them offer to you the portions of the oblation, let them pour out (a layer), let them sprinkle (it).&rsquo; Therefore they offer the portions of the oblation, they pour out (a layer), and sprinkle (it). The theologians say, &lsquo;For what reason are the other offerings worn out, but the oblation fresh?&rsquo; He should reply, &lsquo;Because it is Prajapati&rsquo;s [1], for Prajapati is of the gods the fresh one.&rsquo; The metres ran away from the gods (saying), &lsquo;We will not bear the offering, if we have no share.&rsquo; They kept for them (the offering) divided into four parts, for the Puronuvakya, the Yajya, the deity, the Vasat call. In that he offers (the offering) in four parts, he delights the metres, and they delighted by him carry the offering to the gods. The Angirases were the last to go hence to the world of heaven. The Rsis came to the place of sacrifice; they [2] saw the sacrificial cake creeping about, having become a tortoise. They said to it, &lsquo;Be firm for Indra; be firm for Brhaspati: be firm for the All-gods.&rsquo; It did not become firm. They said to it, &lsquo;Be firm for Agni.&rsquo; It became firm for Agni. In that (the cake) for Agni on eight potsherds is unmoved at the full and at the new moon, (it serves) to conquer the world of heaven. They said to it, &lsquo;How hast thou been left?&rsquo; &lsquo;I have not been anointed&rsquo;, he said, &lsquo;just as an axle not anointed [3] goes wrong, so I have gone wrong.&rsquo; After anointing it above, he anoints it below, to gain the world of heaven. He spreads (the cake) on all the fragments; so many cakes does he conquer in yonder world. That which is burnt belongs to Nirrti, that which is not cooked to Rudra, that which is cooked to the gods. Therefore one should cook it, without burning it, for the gods. He covers it with ashes; therefore the bones are clothed with flesh. He covers it with the bunch of grass; therefore [4] the head is covered with hair. The offering which is cooked without being sprinkled has fallen from this world, but has not reached the world of the gods. He sprinkles it before covering it; verily he makes it go among the gods. If one fragment were lost, one month of the year would be omitted, and the sacrificer would perish. If two were lost, two months of the year would be omitted, and the sacrificer would perish. He counts before covering, to guard the sacrificer [5]. If it be lost, be should make an offering on two potsherds to the Aśvins, and on one potsherd to sky and earth. The Aśvins are the physicians of the gods; verily by them he heals it. Then is offered an offering on one potsherd to sky and earth; in them is lost what is lost; verily in them he finds it, (and it serves) for support.</p>
<h4 id="04-13">04</h4>
<p>(Saying) &lsquo;On the impulse of the god Savitr thee&rsquo;, he takes the sword, for impelling. &lsquo;With the arms of the Aśvins&rsquo;, he says, for the Aśvins were the Adhvaryus of the gods. &lsquo;With the hands of Pusan&rsquo;, he says, for restraint. &lsquo;Thou art a hundred-edged, of the tree, slayer of the foe&rsquo;, he says; verily he sharpens the bolt, being about to hurl it at his enemy. He throws away the grass with a Yajus. The</p>
<p>earth is the size of the altar; verily he deprives his enemy of so much of that [1]. Therefore they do not deprive one who has no share. He throws it away thrice; these worlds are three; verily he excludes him from these worlds. He throws it silently a fourth time; verily he excludes him from the unmeasured. He uproots it; verily what of it is impure he cuts off. He uproots it; therefore the plants perish. He cuts the root; verily he cuts the root of the enemy. If dug too deep, it has the Pitrs for its deity; so much does he dig as is measured [2] by Prajapati as the mouth of the sacrifice. He digs until (he reaches) support; verily he causes the sacrificer to reach support. He makes it higher on the south; verily he makes it the form of the sacrificial ground. He makes it full of loose earth; loose earth is offspring and cattle; verily he makes him full of offspring and cattle. He performs the second drawing of a boundary. The earth is the size of the altar; verily having excluded his enemy from so much of it, he performs the second drawing of a boundary for himself. Cruelly he acts [3] in making an altar. (With the words) &lsquo;Thou art the holder, thou art the self holder&rsquo;, it is made smooth, for healing. He places the sprinkling waters; the waters are Raksas-slaying; (verily they serve) for slaying the Raksases. He places them in the path made by the sword, for the continuity of the sacrifice. He should think of any one whom he hates; verily does he inflict trouble upon him.</p>
<h4 id="05-13">05</h4>
<p>The theologians say, &lsquo;Thou hast sprinkled the offerings with water; but the waters with what?&rsquo; &lsquo;With the holy power (Brahman)&rsquo;, he should say, for verily he sprinkles the offerings with water, and the waters with the holy power (Brahman). He sprinkles the kindling-wood and the sacrificial strew; verily he makes it pure. He sprinkles the altar, the altar was rough, hairless, and impure; verily he makes it pure. &lsquo;To the sky thee, to the atmosphere thee, to earth thee&rsquo;, (with these words) he places the sacrificial strew and sprinkles it [1]; verily he sprinkles it for these worlds. Cruelly indeed does he act in that he digs. He pours down the waters, for healing. He takes the bunch in front; verily he makes it the chief. He takes so much as is measured by Prajapati as the mouth of the sacrifice. He spreads the sacrificial strew, the sacrificial strew is offspring, the altar is the earth; verily he places offspring on the earth. He strews it so as not to be very discernible; verily he makes him not very discernible by offspring and cattle [2]. He puts the bundle over the sacrificial strew, the strew is offspring, the bundle the sacrificer; verily he makes the sacrificer superior to the non-sacrificer. Therefore the sacrificer is superior to the non-sacrificer. He puts (grass) between, for separation. He anoints it; verily he makes it into an offering and causes it to go to the world of heaven. He anoints it in three places; these worlds are three; verily he anoints it for these worlds. He does not break off (its edges); if he were to break them off, it would not go aloft for the sacrificer. He pushes it upwards as it were [3], for the world of heaven is upwards as it were. He depresses it; verily he brings down rain for him. He should not put forward the points too much; if he were to do so, there would be a violent torrent to destroy the Adhvaryu. He should not throw it (so that the roots are) in front. If he were to do this, he would thrust the sacrificer from the world of heaven. He puts it forward (with its points) to the east; verily he makes the sacrificer go to the world of heaven. He should not spread (the bunch) in all directions. If he were to spread (it) in all directions [4], a daughter would be born to him. He strews it upwards, for upwards is as it were connected with a man; verily a male child is born to him. If he were to smooth it with the sword or the poking-stick, that would be his ruin. He smooths it with his hand, for the protection of the sacrificer. The theologians say, &lsquo;What in the sacrifice is the sacrificer&rsquo; &lsquo;The bundle&rsquo; (is the reply). &lsquo;Where in it is the world of heaven?&rsquo; &lsquo;The Ahavaniya (fire)&rsquo; he should reply. In that he puts the bundle on the Ahavaniya, he makes the sacrificer [5] go to the world of heaven. The sacrificer is rent in that they smooth the bundle; he throws the strew along after it, for calming. The Adhvaryu has no support, and he is liable to be seized by shivering. (With the words), &lsquo;Thou art firm (dhruva)&rsquo;, he strokes it; the Dhruva is this (earth); verily he finds support in it, and shivers not. &lsquo;Has he gone, O Agnidh? he says. If (the Agnidh) were to say, &lsquo;Agni has gone?&rsquo; he would make Agni go into the fire, and exclude the sacrificer from the world of heaven. So he should say only &lsquo;Has he gone?&rsquo; Verily he makes the sacrificer go to the world of heaven.</p>
<h4 id="06-13">06</h4>
<p>Agni had three elder brothers; they perished while carrying the offering to the gods. Agni was afraid, &lsquo;Thus indeed will this one fall on misfortune.&rsquo; He ran away, and entered the waters. The gods sought to start him up. The fish proclaimed him, and he cursed it, &lsquo;At Pleasure may they slay thee, since thou hast proclaimed me.&rsquo; So they slay the fish at pleasure, for he is cursed [1]. They found him; they said, &lsquo;Come to us, and carry the offering for us.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;Let me choose a boon; whatever of the offering when it is taken (in the ladle) falls outside the enclosing-sticks, let that be the share of my brothers.&rsquo; There fore whatever of the offering when it is taken falls outside the enclosing sticks is their share; verily by it he delights them. He puts the enclosing sticks around, to smite away the Raksases. He makes them touch [2], so that the Raksases may not creep through. He puts none in front, for the sun rises in front and smites away the Raksases. He places the two kindling sticks upright, for upwards they smite away the Raksases. (He places) one with a Yajus, the other in silence, to make a pair. He places two, the sacrificer has two feet, for support. The theologians say, &lsquo;He indeed would be a sacrificer who should be the stronger for a failure in the sacrifice.&rsquo; (The words), &lsquo;To the lord of earth hail! To the lord of the world, hail! To the lord of creatures [3] hail! ' he should pronounce over the spilt (offering). Thus by a failure in the sacrifice he becomes stronger, for he delights more gods (than usual). There is sameness in the sacrifice, in that there are two sacrificial cakes (offered) in order. Between them he offers the silent sacrifice, to break the sameness and to make a pair. Agni was in yonder world, Yama in this. The gods said, &lsquo;Come, let us interchange them&rsquo;; with food the gods invited Agni [4], with the kingdom the Pitrs Yama; therefore is Agni the food-eater of the gods, Yama the king of the Pitrs; he who knows thus obtains the kingdom and food. To him they gave that share which they cut off for Agni Svistakrt. In that he cuts off a share for Agni Svistakrt, he gives Rudra a share. He cuts off one in each case, for Rudra is one as it were. He cuts off from the north part, for this is Rudra&rsquo;s [5] quarter; verily he appeases Rudra in his own quarter. He sprinkles it twice, to make it divided into four. The former offerings are cattle, Agni is Rudra here; if he were to pour over the former offerings, he would give Rudra cattle, and the sacrificer would be without cattle. He offers leaving the former oblations aside, to protect the cattle.<br>

<p>Manu desired what of earth was sacrificial. He found the poured out ghee. He said, &lsquo;Who is able to produce this also at the sacrifice?&rsquo; Mitra and Varuna said, &lsquo;We are able to produce the cow.&rsquo; Then they set the cow in motion. Wherever she stepped, there ghee was pressed out; therefore she is called ghee-footed; that is her origin. &lsquo;The Rathantara is invoked with the earth&rsquo;, he says [1]. The Rathantara is this (earth); verily he invokes her with food. &lsquo;The Vamadevya is invoked with the atmosphere&rsquo;, he says. The Vamadevya, is cattle; verily he invokes cattle with the atmosphere. &lsquo;The Brhat is invoked with the sky&rsquo;, he says. The Brhat is connected with food; verily he invokes food with the sky. ' The seven Hotras are invoked&rsquo;, he says; verily he invokes the Hotras. &lsquo;The cow is invoked with the bull&rsquo;, he says [2]; verily he invokes a pair. &lsquo;The friend food is invoked&rsquo;, he says; verily he invokes the Soma drink. &lsquo;It is invoked; ho!&rsquo; he says; verily he invokes the self, for the self is the best of those invoked. He invokes food, food is cattle; verily he invokes cattle. He invokes four, for cattle are four-footed. &lsquo;Offspring of Manu&rsquo;, he says, for Manu first saw her [3]. &lsquo;Ghee footed&rsquo;, he says. Because ghee was pressed out of her foot, therefore be says thus. &lsquo;Of Mitra and Varuna&rsquo;, he says, for Mitra and Varuna set her in motion. &lsquo;The Brahman, god made, is invoked&rsquo;, he says; verily he invokes the Brahman. &lsquo;The divine Adhvaryus are invoked, the human are invoked&rsquo;, he says; verily he invokes the gods and men. &lsquo;Who shall help this sacrifice and make the lord of the sacrifice prosper&rsquo;, he says [4]; verily he invokes a blessing for the sacrifice and the sacrificer. &lsquo;Sky and earth are invoked&rsquo;, he says; verily he invokes sky and earth. &lsquo;Born of yore, the righteous&rsquo;, he says, for they were born of yore and are righteous. &lsquo;Divine, with gods for children&rsquo;, he says, for they are divine and have gods for children. &lsquo;Invoked is this sacrificer&rsquo;, he says; verily he invokes the sacrificer. &lsquo;Invoked in the highest sacrifice, invoked in the greater offering, invoked in the divine abode&rsquo; [5], he says. The highest sacrifice is offspring, the greater offering is cattle, the divine abode</p>
<p>is the world of heaven. (With the words), &lsquo;Thou art this; thou art this&rsquo;, he invokes the dear abode of the sacrifice. &lsquo;All that is dear to it is invoked&rsquo;, he says; verily not vainly does he invoke.</p>
<h4 id="08-13">08</h4>
<p>Food is cattle, he takes it himself; verily by himself he fills his desires of cattle, for no one else can grant him his desire of cattle. &lsquo;Thee offered to the lord of speech I eat&rsquo;, he says; verily he delights speech with a share. &lsquo;Thee offered to the lord of the Sadas I eat&rsquo;, he says, for completion.&rsquo; (The food) is divided. in four; what is divided in four is the offering, what is divided in four is cattle; if the Hotr were to eat it, the Hotr would [1] experience misfortune; if he were to offer it in the fire, he would give the cattle to Rudra, and the sacrificer would be without cattle. &lsquo;Thee offered to the lord of speech I eat&rsquo;, he says; verily secretly does he offer it. &lsquo;Thee offered to the lord of the Sadas&rsquo;, he says, for completion. They eat; they eat at a suitable moment; he gives a sacrificial gift; at a suitable moment be gives a gift. They cleave the sacrifice [2], if they eat in the middle. They purify it with water; all the gods are the waters; verily they connect the sacrifice with the gods. The gods excluded Rudra from the sacrifice; he pierced the sacrifice, the gods gathered round it (saying), &lsquo;May it be right for us.&rsquo; They said, &lsquo;Well offered will this be for us, if we propitiate him.&rsquo; That is why Agni is called the &lsquo;well offerer&rsquo; (svistakrt). When it was pierced (by him) [3] they cut off (a piece) of the size of a barleycorn; therefore one should cut off (a piece) the size of a barleycorn. If one were to cut off more, he would confuse that part of the sacrifice. If he were to make a layer and then to sprinkle, lie would make it swell on both sides. He cuts it off and sprinkles it; there are two operations; the sacrificer has two feet, for support. If he were to transfer it (to the Brahman) crosswise, he would pierce the unwounded part of the sacrifice; lie transfers it in front; verily he transfers it in the proper way. They transferred it for Pusan [4]. Pusan having eaten it lost his teeth; therefore Pusan has pounded food for his share, for he has no teeth. The gods said of him, &lsquo;He has lost (his teeth), he is not fit for the offering.&rsquo; They transferred it to Brhaspati. Brhaspati was afraid, &lsquo;Thus indeed will this one fall on misfortune.&rsquo; He saw this Mantra; &lsquo;With the eye of the sun I gaze on thee&rsquo;, he said, for the eye of the sun harms no one [5]. He was afraid, &lsquo;It will harm me as I take it.&rsquo; &lsquo;On the impulse of the god Savitr, with the arms of the Aśvins, with the hands of Pusan I take thee&rsquo;, he says; verily, impelled by Savitr, he took it with the holy power (Brahman) and with the gods. He was afraid, &lsquo;It will harm me as I eat.&rsquo; &lsquo;Thee with the mouth of Agni I eat&rsquo;, he said, for nothing harms the mouth of Agni. He was afraid [6], &lsquo;It will harm me when I have eaten.&rsquo; &lsquo;With the belly of the Brahman&rsquo;, he said, for nothing harms the belly of the Brahman. &lsquo;With the holy power (Brahman) of Brhaspati&rsquo;, (he said), for he is fullest of the holy power (Brahman). The breaths indeed depart from him who eats this offering; by purifying it with water he grasps the breaths; the breaths are ambrosia, the waters ambrosia; verily he summons the breaths according to their places.</p>
<h4 id="09-12">09</h4>
<p>He takes a portion for the Agnidh; verily he delights the seasons whose mouth is Agni. He takes a kindling-stick, for the support of the subsequent offerings; verily he pours on that which has a kindling stick. He rubs the enclosing-sticks; verily he purifies them. He rubs each once, for the sacrifice there is as it were turned away. It makes up four, cattle are four-footed; verily he wins cattle. &lsquo;O Brahman, will we set out?&rsquo; he says; there indeed is the sacrifice placed [1], where the Brahman is; where the sacrifice is placed, thence does he commence it. If he were to instigate him with his hand, he would shiver; if with his head, he would have a headache; if he were to sit in silence, the sacrifice would not proceed; he should say, &lsquo;Set out! In speech the sacrifice is placed; where the sacrifice is placed, thence does he bestow it. &lsquo;O god Savitr, that he [2] hath proclaimed to thee&rsquo;, he says, for impelling. &lsquo;Brhaspati is the (priest) Brahman&rsquo;, he says, for he is fullest of the holy power (Brahman). &lsquo;Do thou guard the sacrifice, guard the lord of the sacrifice, guard me&rsquo;, he says; for the sacrifice, the sacrificer, and himself, for these he thus invokes a blessing, to prevent misfortune, Having caused (him) to call out, he says, &lsquo;Utter the verse for sacrifice to the gods.&rsquo; The theologians say, &lsquo;The gods have been sacrificed to; what gods are they?&rsquo; &lsquo;The metres&rsquo;, he should reply, &lsquo;Gayatri Tristubh [3], and Jagati.&rsquo; Then they say, &lsquo;The metres are the Brahmans&rsquo;; verily he sacrifices to them. The deities were sacrificed to by the gods; then Agni did not burn forth; the gods</p>
<h4 id="10-12">10</h4>
<p>The gods could not find any one to utter the call Svaga at the sacrifice. They spoke to Çamyu Barhaspatya, &lsquo;Perform the Svaga call at this sacrifice for us.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;Let me choose a boon; if a faithless man sacrifice, or a man sacrifices without prescription, let the blessing of such a sacrificer be mine.&rsquo; Therefore if a faithless man sacrifices, or a man sacrifices without prescription, the blessing of such a sacrifice goes to Çamyu Barhaspatya. &lsquo;That is mine&rsquo;, he said, &lsquo;What is to belong to my offspring? [1].&rsquo; &lsquo;Him, who reviles him, he shall fine with a hundred; him, who strikes him, he shall fine with a thousand; he, who draws blood from him, shall not behold the world of the Pitrs for as many years as are the grains of dust which the blood in its fall seizes upon&rsquo;, (they replied). Therefore one should not revile a Brahman, nor strike him, nor draw blood from him; for so great is his sin. &lsquo;That health and wealth we choose&rsquo;, he says; verily he utters the call Svaga, over the sacrifice. &lsquo;That [2] health and wealth we choose&rsquo;, he says; verily he gives Çamyu Barhaspatya his portion. &lsquo;Success to the sacrifice, success to the sacrificer&rsquo;, he says; verily he invokes this blessing. He sacrifices to Soma; verily he places seed; he sacrifices to Tvastr; seed is placed and Tvastr moulds forms; he sacrifices to the wives of the gods, to make a pair; he sacrifices to Agni, lord of the house, for support. There is sameness in the sacrifice [3] in that the fore-sacrifices are offered with butter, and the sacrifices to the wives (are offered) with butter. Having repeated the Rc, of the sacrifices to the wives he offers with a Rc, to prevent sameness, and to make a pairing. The sacrifice has a fivefold prelude and a fivefold end; there are offered five fore-sacrifices; there are four sacrifices to the wives, the fifth is the Samistayajus by they make up five as a prelude, and five as an end.</p>

<p>Prajapati desired, &lsquo;May I create offspring.&rsquo; He did penance, he created serpents. He desired, &lsquo;May I create offspring.&rsquo; He did penance a second time, he created birds. He desired, &lsquo;May I create offspring.&rsquo; He did penance a third time, he saw this speech of the consecrated, he spoke it. Then indeed did he create offspring. In that after undergoing penance he speaks the speech of the consecrated, the sacrificer thus [1] creates offspring. If one who is consecrated sees anything impure, the consecration departs from him; his dark colour, his beauty goes away. &lsquo;Mind unbound; eye weak; sun best of lights; O consecration, forsake me not&rsquo;, he says, and consecration departs not from him, his dark colour and his beauty go not away. If rain falls on one who is consecrated, the heavenly waters if unappeased destroy his force, might, consecration [2], and penance. &lsquo;Do ye flowing waters place might (in me), place force, place might; do not destroy my consecration, nor my penance&rsquo;, he says; verily he places all that in himself; they do not destroy his force, might, consecration, or penance. Agni is the divinity of the consecrated man, and he is concealed as it were from him, when he goes (out), and the Raksases are able to hurt him [3]. &lsquo;From good to better do thou advance; may Brhaspati be thy forerunner&rsquo;, he says. Brhaspati is the holy power (Brahman) of the gods; verily he grasps hold of him, and he brings him safely through. &lsquo;Here we have come (a idam) to the place on earth for sacrifice to the gods&rsquo;, he says, for he comes to the place on earth for sacrifice, who sacrifices. &lsquo;Wherein aforetime all the gods rejoiced&rsquo;, he says, for all the gods delight in it, in that the Brahmans so do. &lsquo;Accomplishing (the rite) with Rc, Saman, and Yajus&rsquo;, he says, for he who sacrifices accomplishes (the rite) with Rc, Saman, and Yajus. &lsquo;Let us rejoice in fullness of wealth, in sustenance&rsquo;, he says; verily he invokes this blessing.</p>

<p>&lsquo;This is thy Gayatri part&rsquo;, say for me to Soma.<br>

He who purchases King Soma after making it go to the world of lordship, becomes lord of his own (people). The world of lordship of King Soma is the metres; he should utter these verses before the purchase of Soma. It is to the world of lordship that he makes it go when he buys (Soma) [1], and he becomes lord of his own. He, who knows the support of the Tanunaptra finds support. The theologians say, &lsquo;They do not eat, nor offer; then where does the Tanunaptra find support?&rsquo; &lsquo;In Prajapati, in the mind, he should reply. He should smell at it thrice, (saying), &lsquo;In Prajapati thee, in the mind I offer&rsquo;; this indeed is the support of the Tanunaptra; he who knows thus finds support. He who [2] knows the support of the Adhvaryu finds support. He should call (on the Agnidhra) standing in the place without moving whence he is minded to sacrifice. This is the support of the Adhvaryu; he who knows thus finds support. If he were to sacrifice moving about, he would lose his support; therefore he should sacrifice standing in the same place, for support. He who knows the possession of the Adhvaryu, becomes possessed (of what he needs). His possession is the offering spoon, his possession is the Vayu cup, his [3] possession is the beaker. If he were to call without holding the Vayu cup or the beaker, he would lose his own; therefore he must hold it when he calls; verily he loses not his own. If he begins the litany without placing the Soma,&quot; the Soma is not supported, the Stoma is not supported, the hymns are not supported, the sacrificer is not supported, the Adhvaryu is not supported. The support of the Soma is the Vayu cup, the support of it is the beaker, (the support) of the Stoma is Soma, (the support) of the hymns is the Stoma. He should grasp the cup or fill up the beaker, and then begin the litany; a support to the Soma he verily (eva) gives, to the Stoma, to the hymns; the sacrificer finds support, the Adhvaryu finds support.</p>

<p>They gather together the sacrifice when (they gather the dust of) the foot-print of the Soma cow; the oblation-holders are the mouth of the sacrifice; when they move forward the oblation-holders, then he should oil the axle with it; verily he extends the sacrifice in the mouth of the sacrifice. They lead<br>
Agni forward, they take the wife forward, and they make the carts follow after. Now the altar of him (Agni) is deserted; he broods on it, and is liable to become terrible (rudrá) [1], and lay to rest the offspring and cattle of the sacrificer. When they are leading northward the sacrificial animal over which the Apris have been said, he should take (from the altar the fire) for cooking it; verily he makes him share in it. The Ahavaniya is the sacrificer; if they take (the fire) for cooking the victim from the Ahavaniya, they tear the sacrificer asunder; the fire should therefore be thus, or he should make it by friction, so that the sacrificer&rsquo;s body may remain together. If a portion of the victim be lost, he should cut off an equivalent portion of the butter; that is then the atonement. If men disturb his victim and he wish of them, &lsquo;May they come to ruin&rsquo;, he should make an offering in the Agnidh&rsquo;s altar with the Rc containing the word &lsquo;paying of homage&rsquo; (and beginning), &lsquo;What then?&rsquo; Verily he appropriates their paying of homage and speedily do they go to ruin.</p>

<p>Cattle belong to Prajapati; their overlord is Rudra. In that he prepares (them) with these two (verses), verily by addressing him with them he secures him, so that his self is not injured. He prepares (them) with two; the sacrificer has two feet; (verily it serves) for support. Having prepared them, he offers five libations; cattle are fivefold; I verily he wins cattle. Now the victim is led to death, and if he should lay hold on it, the sacrificer would be likely to die. ' The breath of the sacrifice is apart from the victim&rsquo;, he says, for distinction [1]. &lsquo;If the victim has uttered a cry&rsquo;&ndash;(with these words) he offers a libation, for calming. &lsquo;O ye slayers, come to the sacrifices&rsquo;, he says; that is according to the text. When the omentum. is being taken, the strength goes away from Agni. &lsquo;Thee they keep to carry the offering&rsquo;&ndash;(with these words) he pours a libation over the omentum; verily he wins the strength of Agni; (it serves) also for making (the victim) ready. In the case of some gods the cry of &lsquo;hail!&rsquo; is uttered before (an offering), in the case of others the cry of &lsquo;hail!&rsquo; is uttered after. &lsquo;Hail to the gods, to the gods hail!'&ndash;(with these words) he pours a libation on either side of the omentum; verily he delights both (sets of gods).</p>

<p>&lsquo;He who performs the sacrifice not according to the deities falls a victim to the deities, he becomes worse. He who (performs) in accordance with the deities does not fall a victim to the deities, he becomes better. He should rub the Agnidh&rsquo;s place with a verse addressed to Agni, the oblation holder with one addressed to Visnu, the offering-spoons with one addressed to Agni, the Vayu cups with one addressed to Vayu, the Sadas with one addressed to Indra. Thus he forms the sacrifice in accordance with the deities, he does not fall a victim to the deities, he becomes better.</p>

The Aśvins are the deity, Pañkti the metre, thou art the vessel of the Aśvins. Surya is the deity, Brhati the metre [2], thou art the vessel of the pure (Soma). Candramas is the deity, Satobrhati the metre, thou art the vessel of the mixed (Soma). The All-gods are the deity, Usnih the metre, thou art the vessel of the opening offering.

<p>The Adhvaryu is he that brings trouble on the sacrificer, and he that brings trouble himself is ruined before the trouble. &lsquo;From the formula spoken, guard me, from every execration&rsquo;&ndash;(with these words) he should pour a libation before the morning litany (of the Hotr). So the Adhvaryu girds himself in front with a protection, to avert trouble.<br>
For entry thee, for rest thee, for the overcoming of the Gayatri, of the Tristubh, of the Jagati, hail! O expiration and inspiration, protect me from death, O expiration and inspiration forsake me not.<br>
They contend as to the deities and to expiration and inspiration [1], whose Soma (offerings) compete. &lsquo;For entry thee, for rest thee&rsquo;, he says; entry and rest are the metres; verily by the metres he appropriates his metres. The Ajya (Stotras) have the word &lsquo;forward&rsquo; in them, for conquest. The beginning verses are addressed to the Maruts, for victory. Both the Brhat and the Rathantara (Samans) are used. The Rathantara is this (earth), the What yonder (sky); verily he cuts him off from these two. The Rathantara is to-day, the Brhat to-morrow; verily he cuts him off from to-day and to-morrow. The Rathantara is the past [2], the Brhat the future; verily he cuts him off from the past and the future. The Rathantara is the measured, the Brhat the unmeasured; verily he cuts him off from the measured and the unmeasured. Viśvamitra and Jamadagni had a quarrel with Vasistha. Jamadagni saw this Vihavya (hymn), and by means of it he appropriated the power and strength of Vasistha. In that the Vihavya is recited, the sacrificer appropriates the power and strength of his enemy. &lsquo;He who performs more rites of sacrifice&rsquo;, they say, &lsquo;appropriates the gods.&rsquo; If the Soma (sacrifice) on the other side is an Agnistoma, he should perform an Ukthya; if it is an Ukthya, he should perform an Atiratra; verily by means of rites of sacrifice he appropriates his deities; he becomes better.</p>

<h5 id="c-102">c</h5>
<p>When the Soma is pressed [2] the first drop which falls has potency to destroy the power, strength, offspring, and cattle of the sacrificer; he should pronounce over it the formula, &lsquo;Thou hast fallen to me with offspring, with abundance of wealth; destroy not my power and strength&rsquo;; verily he invokes this blessing to prevent the destruction of his power, strength, offering, and cattle.</p>

<p>Some libations have bases, some have not. Those which have a sprinkling have bases, those [2] of Soma have not bases. Taking (the cup) for Indra and Vayu he should sprinkle it (saying), &lsquo;May the sacrifice be harmless for plants, for our cattle, for our folk; for all creatures harmless thou art; swell like ghee, O god Soma.&rsquo; Verily so he makes the libations of Soma to have a base. He becomes possessed of a base who knows thus. Verily also he wets with ghee the sky and earth: they being wet are to be lived upon; he is to be lived upon [3] who knows thus.</p>

<p>Manu divided his property among his sons. He deprived Nabhanedistha, who was a student, of any portion. He went to him, and said, &lsquo;How hast thou deprived me of a portion?&rsquo; He replied, &lsquo;I have not deprived you of a portion; the Angirases here are performing a Sattra; they [4] cannot discern the world of heaven; declare this Brahmana to them; when they go to the, world of heaven they will give thee their cattle.&rsquo; He told them it, and they when going to the world of heaven gave him their cattle. Rudra approached him as he went about with his cattle in the place of sacrifice, and said, &lsquo;These are my cattle.&rsquo; He replied, &lsquo;They have given them [5] to me.&rsquo; They have not the power to do that&rsquo;, he replied, (whatever is left on the place of sacrifice is mine.&rsquo; Then one should not resort to a place of sacrifice. He said, &lsquo;Give me a share in the sacrifice, and I will not have designs against your cattle. He poured out for him the remnants of the mixed (Soma). Then indeed had Rudra no designs against his cattle. When one who knows thus offers the remnants of the mixed (Soma), Rudra has no designs against his cattle.</p>

<h3 id="ii-the-supplement-to-the-soma-sacrifice-continued">II The Supplement to the Soma Sacrifice (continued)</h3>
<p>iii. 2. 1. He who sacrifices knowing the &lsquo;ascent&rsquo; verses of the Pavamana (Stotras) mounts on the Pavamanas and is not cut off from the Pavamanas. &lsquo;Thou art the hawk, with the Gayatri for thy metre; I grasp thee; bring me over in safety. Thou art the eagle, with the Tristubh for thy metre; I grasp thee; bring me over in safety. Thou art the vulture, with the Jagati for thy metre; I grasp thee; bring me over in safety&rsquo;, he says. These [1] are the ascents of the Pavamanas; he who knowing thus these sacrifices mounts on the Pavamanas, and is not cut off from the Pavamanas. He who knows the continuity of the Pavamana lives all his days; he does not die before his time; be becomes rich in cattle; he obtains offspring. The Pavamana cups are drawn off, but these are not drawn off by him, the wooden vessel, the stirring-vessel, and the vessel which holds the purified Soma. If he were to begin (the Stotra) without drawing them off, he would split the Pavamana [2], and with its being split the breath of the Adhvaryu would be split. &lsquo;Thou art taken with a support; to Prajapati thee!&rsquo;, (with these words) he should rub the wooden vessel; &lsquo;to Indra thee!&rsquo;, (with these words) the stirring-vessel; &lsquo;to the All-gods thee!&rsquo;, (with these words) the vessel which holds the purified Soma verily he renders continuous the Pavamana, he lives all his days; he does not die before his time; he becomes rich in cattle; he obtains offspring.</p>
<h4 id="02-14">02</h4>
<p>There are three pressings. Now they spoil the third pressing if there are no stalks of the Soma in it. Having offered the silent cup, he puts a shoot in the vessel which holds it, and placing it with the third pressing he should press it out. In that he makes it swell, it has a stalk (of the Soma); in that he presses it out, it has the lees (of the Soma); verily he makes all the pressings have stalks and pure Soma, and be of equal strength.<br>
Two oceans are there extended, unperishing;<br>
They revolve in turns like the waves in the bosom of the sea;<br>
Seeing they pass over one of them,<br>
Seeing not [1] they pass over the other with a bridge.<br>
Two garments continuous one weareth;<br>
With locks, knowing all the worlds;<br>
He goeth in secret clad in the dark;<br>
He putteth on his bright robe abandoning that of the worn-out one.<br>
Whatever the gods did at the sacrifice the Asuras did. The gods saw this great sacrifice, they extended it, they performed the Agnihotra as the vow; therefore one should perform the vow twice, for twice they offer the Agnihotra. They performed the full moon rite, as the animal sacrifice to Agni and Soma [2]. They performed the new moon rite, as the animal sacrifice to Agni. They performed the sacrifice to the All-gods as the morning pressing. They performed the Varunapraghasas, as the midday pressing. They performed the Sakamedhas, the sacrifice to the fathers, and the offering to Tryambaka, as the third pressing. The Asuras sought to follow their</p>
<p>sacrifice, but could not get on its tracks. They said, &lsquo;These gods have become inviolable (adhvartavyah). That is why the sacrifice (adhvara) is inviolable. Then the gods prospered, the Asuras were defeated. He who knowing thus offers the Soma, prospers himself, the enemy is defeated.</p>

The Udgithas are similar for the priests, the Udgitha for the Udgatrs, [5], the Rces and the Pranavas for the singers of hymns, the response for the Adhvaryus. He, who knowing thus responds, becomes an eater of food, a strong one is born among his offspring. The Hotr is this (earth), the Adhvaryu yonder (sky); in that he recites sitting, so the Hotr goes not away from the (earth), for this (earth) is seated as it were; verily thereby the sacrifice milks this (earth). In that he responds standing, so the Adhvaryu goes not away from yonder (sky) [6], for yonder (sky) stands as it were; verily thereby the sacrificer milks yonder (sky). In that he recites sitting, therefore the gods live on that which is given hence; in that he responds standing, therefore men live on what is given thence. In that he recites seated towards the east, and he responds standing towards the west, therefore seed is impregnated in front, offspring are born behind. In that the Hotr addresses the Adhvaryu, he makes the thunderbolt advance towards him; he turns towards the West; verily he overcomes the thunderbolt.</p>

Prajapati saw the Viraj; by it he created the past and the future; he concealed it from the Rsis; by penance Jamadagni beheld it, and by it he created various delights; that is why the various (cups) have their name. In that the various (cups) are drawn, so the sacrificer wins various delights. &lsquo;Thou art the wind, expiration [2] by name&rsquo;, he says; verily he wins expiration and inspiration.&rsquo; &lsquo;Thou art the eye, the ear by name&rsquo;, he says; verily he wins life. &lsquo;Thou art the form, colour by name&rsquo;, he says; verily he wins offspring. &lsquo;Thou art holy order, truth by name&rsquo;, he says; verily he wins lordly power. &lsquo;Thou art the past, the future by name&rsquo;, he says; the foetus of the waters and the plants is cattle; verily he wins cattle [3]. So much as is around a man, that does he thus win. &lsquo;Thee for the realm of holy order&rsquo;, he says; the realm of holy order is this (earth); verily he conquers this (earth). &lsquo;Thee for the might of holy order&rsquo;, he says; the might of holy order is the atmosphere; verily he conquers the atmosphere. &lsquo;Thee for the circumference of holy order&rsquo;, he says; the circumference of holy order is the sky; verily he conquers the sky. &lsquo;Thee for the truth of holy order&rsquo; [4], he says; the truth of holy order is the quarters; verily he conquers the quarters. &lsquo;Thee for the light of holy order&rsquo;, he says; the light of holy order is the world of heaven; verily he conquers the world of heaven. So many are the worlds of the gods; verily he conquers them. They make up ten; the Viraj has ten syllables, the Viraj is food; verily he finds support in the Viraj, the eating of food.</p>
<h4 id="06-16">06</h4>
<p>What the gods could not win by the sacrifice, that they won by the Para (Grahas), and that is why the Paras have their name. In that the Paras are drawn, (it serves) to win that which one does not win by the sacrifice. The first he draws, by this he conquers the world; the second (he draws), by<br>
this he conquers the atmosphere; the third (he draws), by this he conquers yonder world. In that they are drawn, (they serve) to conquer these worlds [1]. In the latter days they are drawn hitherward from yonder, verily having conquered these worlds they descend again towards this world. In that in the former days they are drawn thitherward from hence, therefore these worlds are thitherward from hence; in that in the latter days they are drawn hitherward from thence, therefore these worlds are hitherward from thence; therefore men depend on the worlds in variation. The theologians say, &lsquo;For what reason do plants spring from the waters, the food of man is plants [2], and offspring are born through Prajapati?&rsquo; &lsquo;Through the Paras&rsquo;, he should reply. In that he draws (saying),&lsquo;For the waters thee, for the plants I take&rsquo;, therefore from the waters plants spring; in that he draws (saying), &lsquo;For the plants thee, for offspring I take&rsquo;, therefore the food of man is the plants; in that he draws (saying), &lsquo;For offspring thee, for Prajapati I take&rsquo;, therefore through Prajapati offspring are born.</p>

<p>Prajapati created the gods and the Asuras; thereafter the sacrifice was created, after the sacrifice the metres; they went away in all directions, the sacrifice went after the Asuras, the metres after the sacrifice; the gods reflected, &lsquo;These have become what we are&rsquo;; they had recourse to Prajapati; Prajapati said, &lsquo;Taking the strength of the metres I shall bestow it upon you.&rsquo; He took the strength of the metres [1] and bestowed it upon them. Then the metres ran away, and the sacrifice followed the metres. Then the gods prospered, the Asuras were defeated. He who knows the strength of the metres&ndash;&lsquo;Do thou proclaim&rsquo;, &lsquo;Be it proclaimed&rsquo;, &lsquo;Utter&rsquo;, &lsquo;We that utter&rsquo;, the Vasat call&ndash;prospers himself, his foe is defeated. The theologians say, &lsquo;For whose gain does the Adhvaryu cause (him) to proclaim?&rsquo; &lsquo;For the strength of the metres&rsquo;, he should reply; &lsquo;Do thou proclaim&rsquo;, &lsquo;Be it proclaimed&rsquo;, &lsquo;Utter&rsquo;, &lsquo;We that utter&rsquo;, the Vasat call, that is the strength of the metres [2]; he who knows thus sings what ever he sings with the metres in full strength. &lsquo;In that Indra, slew Vrtra, there is impurity, in that he destroyed the Yatis, there is impurity; then why is the sacrifice Indra&rsquo;s up to the completion?&rsquo; they say. The sacrifice is the sacrificial body of Indra, and it is this they sacrifice. To him who knows thus the sacrifice resorts.</p>

Yama is Agni, Yama is this (earth); the sacrificer becomes under a debt to Yama in that he strews the altar with plants; if he were to go away with out burning (them), they would drag him about bound by the neck [3] in yonder world. In that he burns, (saying) &lsquo;The loan which I have not yet paid&rsquo;, being here, having made requital of the loan to Yama, he goes freed from the debt to the world of heaven. If he does manifold things as it were, he should offer in the forest (fire) groats with his hand; the forest (fire) is Agni Vaiśvanara; verily he appeases him. On the Ekastaka the divider of the days, he should cook a cake of four Çaravas in size, and early with it should fire the thicket; if [4] it burns, it becomes a good season, if it does not burn, a bad season. By this mode of prognostication the seers of old used to undertake a long Sattra. He who knowing the seer, the hearer, the reciter, sacrifices, is united in yonder world with what he has sacrificed and bestowed. The seer is Agni, the hearer is Vayu, the reciter Aditya; he, who offers knowing thus to them, in yonder world is united with what be has sacrificed and bestowed. &lsquo;May he from in front with the cloud&rsquo; [5], he says; (he that is) from in front with the cloud is Agni; verily he says to Agni, &lsquo;Guard this for me.&rsquo; &lsquo;Do thou, O lord of cloud&rsquo;, he says; the lord of cloud is Vayu; verily he says to Vayu, &lsquo;Guard this for me.&rsquo; &lsquo;O god, that dost fatten&rsquo;, he says; the god that fattens is yonder Aditya; verily he says to Aditya, &lsquo;Guard this for me.&rsquo;<br>

<p>The sacrifice of him whose offering is too large is unsuccessful; &lsquo;Surya, the god, for those that sit in the sky&rsquo;, he says; verily with the aid of Brhaspati and Prajapati he makes good the deficiency in the sacrifice. Now the Raksases infest the victim if it being offered to one deity is greater (than normal); &lsquo;Thou who hast a tawny embryo&rsquo;, he says; verily he sends it to the gods, to smite away the Raksases. &lsquo;Bring near, O bringer&rsquo;, he says [1]; verily with the holy power he brings it. &lsquo;I split apart thy urinator&rsquo;, he says; that is according to the text. &lsquo;The drop, far extending, of all forms&rsquo;, he says; the drop is offspring and cattle; verily with offspring and cattle he unites him. To the sky the deficiency</p>
<p>of the sacrifice goes, to the earth the redundancy; if he were not to appease it, the sacrificer would be ruined; &lsquo;May the two great ones, sky and earth, for us&rsquo; [2], he says; verily by means of sky and earth he appeases both the deficiency and the redundancy of the sacrifice; the sacrificer is not ruined. He covers (the offering) with ashes for the call of &lsquo;Godspeed&rsquo;; now this is the embryo of these two; verily in these two he deposits it. If he were to cut off, he would make it redundant; if he were not to cut off, he would fail to cut off from the victim which has been offered; one portion he should cut off from in front of the navel, another behind it; the expiration is in front of the navel [3], the inspiration behind; verily he cuts off from the whole extent of the victim. He offers to Visnu Çipivista; Visnu Çipivista is the redundancy of the sacrifice, the greatness of the victim, the prosperity thereof; verily in the redundant he deposits the redundant, to appease the redundant. The sacrificial fee is gold of eight measures, for the (victim) has eight feet; the self is the ninth; (verily it serves) to win the victim. It is enveloped in a turban in an inner box, for so as it were is the victim, the omentum, the skin, the flesh, the bone; verily he obtains and wins the whole extent of the victim. He, for whom in the sacrifice this expiration is offered, by his sacrificing becomes richer.</p>

<p>These two were together, Vayu blew them apart; they conceived a child, Soma generated it, Agni swallowed it. Prajapati saw this (offering) to Agni on eight potsherds, he offered it, and thereby he redeemed this (victim) from Agni. Therefore though sacrificing it to another god, still one should first offer on eight potsherds to Agni; verily redeeming it from Agni he offers it. Because [1] Vayu blew (them apart), therefore is it connected with Vayu; because these two conceived, therefore is it connected with sky and earth; because Soma generated, and Agni swallowed, there fore is it connected with Agni and Soma; because when the two parted speech was uttered, therefore is it connected with Sarasvati; because Prajapati redeemed it from Agni, therefore is it connected with Prajapati; the barren goat is connected with all the gods. To Vayu should he offer it who desires wealth. the swiftest deity is Vayu; verily he has recourse to Vayu with his own share [2], and he causes him to attain wealth. To sky and earth should he offer it who in ploughing desires support; verily from the sky Parjanya rains for him, plants spring up in this (earth), his corn prospers. To Agni and Soma should he offer it who desires, &lsquo;May I be possessed of food, an eater of food&rsquo;; by Agni he wins food, by Soma the eating of food; verily he becomes possessed of food, an eater of food. To Sarasvati should he offer it who [3], being able to utter speech, cannot utter speech; Sarasvati is speech; verily he has recourse to Sarasvati with her own share, and she bestows speech upon him. To Prajapati should he offer it who desires, &lsquo;May I gain that which has not been gained&rsquo;;</p>
<p>all the deities are Prajapati; verily by the deities he gains what has not been gained. He brings (the victims) up with a verse ad dressed to Vayu; verily winning it from Vayu he offers it. &lsquo;For intent thee, for desire thee!&rsquo; [4] he says; that is according to the text. He offers with the sound kikkita; at the sound kikkita the domestic animals stop, the wild run away. In that he offers with the sound kikkita, (it serves) to support domestic animals. He offers while the circumambulation by fire is taking place; verily alive he sends it to the world of heaven. &lsquo;Thou, the fourth, art the barren, the eager one&rsquo;, he says; verily he sends it to the gods. &lsquo;Be the desires of the sacrificer fulfilled&rsquo;, he says; this is the desire [5] of the sacrificer that (the sacrifice) should proceed to its conclusion without injury. &lsquo;Thou art the goat, resting in wealth&rsquo;, he says; verily in these worlds he makes it find support. &lsquo;In the sky be thy great radiance&rsquo;, he says; verily in the world of heaven he bestows light upon him. &lsquo;Stretching the thread of the atmosphere do thou pursue the light&rsquo;, he says; verily he makes these worlds full of light for him. &lsquo;Weave ye without a flaw the work of the singers, [6], he says; whatever flaw is committed in the sacrifice, this serves to atone for it. &lsquo;Become Manu; produce thou the host divine&rsquo;, he says; offspring are connected with Manu; verily he makes them fit for food. &lsquo;Thou art the offering of mind&rsquo;, he says, to make &lsquo;Godspeed&rsquo;. &lsquo;May we share thy limbs&rsquo;, he says; verily he invokes this blessing. Of this (victim) there is one time unpropitious for sacrifice to the gods, when a cloud appears when it has been offered [7]; if a cloud should appear when it has been offered, he should either cast it into the waters or eat it whole; if he were to cast it into the waters, he would con fuse the sacrifice; he should eat it whole; verily he bestows power upon himself. By three people is this to be performed, him who performs a year-long Sattra, him who offers with a thousand (gifts), and him who is a domestic sacrificer; with it let them sacrifice, for them is it fit.<br>

In that the All-gods brought together (the materials), the Abhyatanas are connected with the All-gods; in that Prajapati</p>
<p>bestowed the victories (Jayas), therefore the Jayas are connected with Prajapati [1]; in that they won the kingdom by the Rastrabhrts, that is why the Rastrabhrts (supporters of the kingdom) have their name.

Then the gods prospered, the Asuras were defeated. He who has foes should offer these (offerings); verily by the Abhyatanas he overpowers his foes, by the Jayas he conquers them, by the Rastrabhrts he wins the kingdom; he prospers himself, his foe is defeated.</p>

They should be offered for one who desires a village; the Rastrabhrts are the kingdom, his fellows are the kingdom; verily with the kingdom he wins for him his fellows and the kingdom; he becomes possessed of a village [1]. He offers on the dicing-place; verily on the dicing-place he wins his fellows for him, and being won they wait upon him. They should be offered on the mouth of the chariot for him who desires force; the Rastrabhrts are force, the chariot is force; verily by force he wins force for him; he becomes possessed of force. They should be offered for him who is expelled from his kingdom; to all his chariots he should say, &lsquo;Be yoked&rsquo;; verily he yokes the kingdom for him [2]. The oblations of him whose realm is not in order are disordered; he should take off the right wheel of his chariot and offer in the box; so he puts in</p>
<p>order his oblation, and the kingdom comes into order in accord with their coming into order. They should be offered when battle is joined; the Rastrabhrts are the kingdom, and for the kingdom do they strive who go to battle together; he for whom first they offer prospers, and wins this battle. The kindling-wood is from the Madhuka tree [3]; the coals shrinking back make the host of his foe to shrink back. They should be offered for one who is mad; for it is the Gandharva and the Apsarases who madden him who is mad; the Rastrabhrts are the Gandharva and the Apsarases. &lsquo;To him hail!

These (offerings) also should he make who desires cattle; the minor deities are the metres, cattle are as it were the metres [1]; verily by the metres he produces offspring for him. He makes Dhatr first; by him he scatters, Anumati gives approval to him, Raka gives, Sinivali produces, and by Kuhu he establishes offspring when produced. These (offerings) also should he make who desires a village; the minor deities are the metres, a village is as it were the metres; verily by the metres he wins a village for him [2]. He puts Dhatr in the middle; verily he places him in the middle of a village. These (offerings) also should he offer who is long ill; the minor deities are the metres, the metres are unfavourable to him whose illness is long; verily by the metres he makes him well. He puts Dhatr in the middle, it is not in order in the middle of him whose illness is long; verily thereby in the middle he puts (things) in order for him. These (offerings) also [3] should he offer to whom the sacrifice does not resort; the minor deities are the metres, the metres do not resort to him to whom the sacrifice does not resort. He puts Dhatr first; verily in his mouth he places the metres; the sacrifice resorts to him. These (offerings) also should he make who has sacrificed; the minor deities are the metres, the metres of him who has sacrificed are worn out as it were. He puts Dhatr last [4]; verily afterwards he wins for him metres unwearied; the next sacrifice resorts to him. These (offerings) should he make to whom wisdom does not resort; the minor deities are the metres, the metres do not resort to him to whom wisdom does not resort. He puts Dhatr first; verily in his mouth he places the metres; wisdom resorts to him. These (offerings) also should he make [5] who desires brilliance; the minor deities are the metres, brilliance is as it were the metres; verily by the metres he bestows brilliance upon him. They are made in milk; verily he bestows brilliance upon him. He puts Dhatr in the middle; verily he places him in the middle of brilliance. Anumati is the Gayatri, Raka the Tristubh, Sinivali the Jagati, Kuhu the Anustubh, Dhatr the Vasat call.

Thus indeed the minor deities are all the metres and all the gods and the Vasat call. If he were to offer them all at once, they would be likely to burn him up; he should offer first two, and a third for Dhatr, and then offer likewise the last two; thus they do not burn him up, and for whatever desire they are offered that he obtains by them.</p>

In that evening and morning he offers the Agnihotra the sacrificer thus piles up the oblation bricks [1]; the bricks of him who has established a sacred fire are the days and nights; in that he offers evening and morning, verily he obtains the days and nights, and making them into bricks piles them up. He offers ten in the same place; the Viraj has ten syllables; verily having obtained the Viraj, he makes it into a brick and piles it up; verily in the Viraj he obtains the sacrifice; the piling up must be repeated by him. Therefore that is the place of sacrifice where he advances having spent ten (nights); not suitable is the place where (he spends) less time than that [2] Now Vastospati is Rudra. If he were to go on without offering to Vastospati, the fire becoming Rudra would leap after him and slay him; he offers to Vastospati; verily with his own share he appeases him; the sacrificer does not come to ruin. If he were to offer with the chariot yoked, that would be as when one offers an oblation on a place he has left; if he were to offer without the chariot being yoked, that would be as when one offers an oblation at rest; verily no offering would be made to Vastospati [3]. The right (animal) is yoked, the left not yoked, and thus he offers to Vastospati; verily he does both, and appeases him completely. If he were to offer with one (verse) he would make (it) a ladle offering; having pronounced the Puronuvakya he offers with the Yajya, to win the gods. If he were to load (his cart) after the offering, he would make Rudra enter his house. If he were to set out without extinguishing the smouldering embers, it would be like a con fusion of the sacrifice or a burning. &lsquo;This is thy birthplace in season&rsquo;, (with these words) he places (the embers) on the kindling-sticks [4]; this is the birthplace of Agni; verily he mounts it on its own birthplace.

<p>O Agni and Soma, the first in strength,<br>
Do ye quicken the Vasus, the Rudras, the Adityas here;<br>
Rejoice in him of the full moon in the midst,<br>
Ye that are made to grow by holy power, won by good deeds,<br>
And allot to us wealth with heroes.<br>
The Adityas and the Angirases piled up the fires, they desired to obtain the new and the full moon (offerings); the Angirases offered the oblation, then the Adityas saw these two offerings, and offered them; then they first grasped the new and full moon (offerings) [2]. He who is commencing the new and full moon (sacrifices) should first offer these two (offerings); verily straightway he commences the new and full moon (sacrifices). The theologians say, &lsquo;He indeed would begin the new and full moon (sacrifices) who should know the normal and reversed order&rsquo;. What follows on the new moon is the normal, what is after the full moon is the reversed order; if he were to begin the full moon (offering) first, he would offer these two (libations) in reverse order; he would waste away as the moon waned [3]; he should offer these libations to Sarasvant and Sarasvati in front; Sarasvati is the new moon; verily he commences them in normal order; he waxes as the moon waxes. He should offer first on eleven potsherds to Agni and Visnu, to Sarasvati an oblation, to Sarasvant on twelve potsherds. In that it is (offered) to Agni, and the mouth of the sacrifice is Agni, verily he places in front prosperity and the mouth of the sacrifice; in that it is (offered) to Visnu, and Visnu is the sacrifice, verily commencing the sacrifice he continues it. There is an oblation for Sarasvati, and (an offering) on twelve potsherds for Sarasvant; Sarasvati is the new moon, Sarasvant is the full moon; verily straightway he commences these (offerings), he prospers by them. That to Sarasvant is on twelve potsherds, for pairing, for generation. The sacrificial fee is a pair of kine, for prosperity.</p>

<p>The Vasat call cleft the head of the Gayatri; its sap fell away, it entered the earth, it became the Khadira; he, whose dipping-spoon is make of Khadira wood, cuts off with the sap of the metres; his oblations are full of sap. Soma was in the third sky from hence; the Gayatri fetched it, a leaf of it was cut off, that became the Parna, that is why the Parna is so called. He whose ladle is made of Parna wood [1] has his oblations acceptable; the gods rejoice in his oblation. The gods discussed regarding holy power; the Parna overheard it; he whose ladle is made of Parna wood is styled famous; he hears no evil bruit. The Parna is holy power, the Maruts are the people, the people are food, the Aśvattha is connected with the Maruts; he whose ladle is made of Parna wood, and his spoon (upabhrt) is of Aśvattha, by holy power wins food, and the holy class [2] puts over the people. The Parna is the royalty, the Aśvattha is the people; in that the ladle is made of Parna wood and the spoon of Aśvattha, verily he puts the royalty over the people. Prajapati sacrificed; where the oblation found support, thence sprung the Vikankata; there he created offspring; the oblation of him whose Dhruva, is made of Vikankata, wood finds rest; verily he is propagated. That is the form of the offering-spoons; on him whose spoons are so formed all forms of cattle attend, nothing unshapely is born in him.</p>

<h3 id="i-the-placing-of-the-fire-in-the-fire-pan-1">I The Placing of the Fire in the Fire-pan</h3>
<h4 id="01-24">01</h4>
<p>He offers the Savitr offerings, for instigation. He offers with (an oblation) ladled up four times, cattle have four feet; verily he wins cattle; the quarters are four; verily he finds support in the quarters. The metres departed from the gods (saying), &lsquo;We will not carry your oblation without sharing (in it)'; for them they kept this (oblation) ladled up four times, for the Puronuvakya the Yajya, the deity, the Vasat call; in that he offers what has been ladled up four times, he delights the metres, and they delighted carry to the gods his oblation. If he desire of a man [1], &lsquo;May he become worse&rsquo;, he should offer each separately for him; verily he makes him severed from the libations; he becomes worse. If he desire of a man, &lsquo;May he become better&rsquo;, he should offer all for him continuously; verily he makes him master of the libation; he becomes better. This is the mastering of the sacrifice. He abandons prosperity in the beginning of the sacrifice who departs from Agni as the deity; these offerings to Savitr number eight, the Gayatri has eight syllables, Agni is connected with the Gayatri [2]; verily he does not abandon prosperity at the beginning of the sacrifice, nor Agni as the deity. The offerings to Savitr number eight, the libation (as a whole) is the ninth; verily he extends the threefold (Stoma) at the beginning of the sacrifice. If he desire, &lsquo;May I confer on the metres the glory of the sacrifice&rsquo;, he should make a Re verse last; verily he confers on the metres the glory of the sacrifice. If he desire, &lsquo;May I confer on the sacrificer the glory of the sacrifice&rsquo;, he should make a Yajus formula last; verily he confers on the sacrificer the glory of the sacrifice. &lsquo;By the Rc make the Stoma to flourish&rsquo;, he says [3], for prosperity. With four (verses) he takes up the spade; the metres are four; verily (he takes it up) with the metres. &lsquo;On the instigation of god Savitr&rsquo;, he says, for instigation. Agni went away from the gods, he entered the reed; he resorted to the hole which is formed by the perforation of the reed; the spade is perforated to make it his birthplace; wherever he lived, that became black; (the spade) is stained, for perfection of form; it is pointed at both ends, for the winning of light both hence and from yonder world; it is a fathom long; so much is the strength in man; (verily it is) commensurate with his strength; it is unlimited in girth, to win what is unlimited; that tree which has fruit is strong among trees, the reed bears fruit, (the spade) is of reed, to win strength.</p>
<h4 id="02-24">02</h4>
<p>That part of the sacrifice is unsuccessful which is performed with no Yajus. &lsquo;This bond of order they grasped&rsquo;, (with these words) he takes up the horse&rsquo;s halter, to make a Yajus and to make successful the sacrifice. &lsquo;Swiftly run hither, O steed&rsquo;, (with these words) he halters the horse; verily he proclaims its greatness in this form. &lsquo;Yoke ye the ass&rsquo;, (with these words) (he halters) the ass; verily he establishes the ass on the non-existent; therefore the ass is less real than the horse. &lsquo;In each need more strong&rsquo;, he says [1]; verily in each need he yokes him; &lsquo;in each contest we invoke&rsquo;, he says; the contest is food; verily he wins food. &lsquo;As friends, Indra to aid us&rsquo;, he says; verily he wins power. Agni went away from the gods, him Prajapati found; the horse is connected with Prajapati, with the horse he collects (it), for the finding (of Agni). Now confusion occurs in that they perform the same thing with a better and worse (instrument), for the ass is worse than the horse [2]; they lead the horse in front to avoid confusion; therefore the worse follows after the better. Many are the foes of the man who waxes great, he waxes great as it were who piles the fire, the steed has a thunderbolt;</p>
<p>&lsquo;hastening come hither, trampling the enemy&rsquo;, he says; verily he tramples with the thunderbolt on the evil foe; &lsquo;from the lordship of Rudra&rsquo;, he says; cattle are connected with Rudra; verily having begged from Rudra [3] cattle he acts for his own interest. &lsquo;With Pusan as fellow&rsquo;, he says; Pusan is the leader together of roads; (verily it serves) for attainment. The fire has dust for its abode; the Angirases brought it together before the deities; &lsquo;from the abode of earth do thou approach Agni of the dust in the mode of Angiras&rsquo;, he says; verily he brings it together in one abode with the deities. &lsquo;We approach Agni of the dust in the manner of Angiras&rsquo;, he says; verily he appropriates the strength of him whom he meets [4]. &lsquo;The fire should be brought together after announcing it to Prajapati&rsquo;, they say; Prajapati is this earth, the ant-heap is its ear; &lsquo;we will bear Agni of the dust in the manner of Angiras&rsquo;, (with these words) he pays reverence to the mound of an ant-heap; verily after announcing it to Prajapati face to face, he brings together the fire. &lsquo;We bear Agni of the dust in the manner of Angiras&rsquo;, he says; verily he appropriates the strength of him whom he meets. &lsquo;Agni hath gazed along the forefront of the dawns&rsquo; [5], he says, to light up (the heaven). &lsquo;The steed coming, from the way&rsquo;, &lsquo;Coming to earth, O steed&rsquo;, he says; verily he wishes for it with the first and obtains it with the second; with two (verses) he makes it come, for support; (with two) of the same form, therefore cattle are born of the same form. &lsquo;Thy back is the sky, thy abode earth&rsquo;, he says; Prajapati quickened him from these worlds; verily he proclaims its greatness in this form. The steed is possessed of the thunderbolt, by its incisors it is more puissant than those with one row of incisors, by its hair than those with two rows; him whom he hates he should conceive as beneath its feet; verily with the thunderbolt he lays him low.</p>
<h4 id="03-25">03</h4>
<p>&lsquo;The strong steed hath stepped forth&rsquo;, with these two (verses) he makes it step forth; (with two) of the same form, therefore cattle are born of the same form. He pours water down; where there are waters, there Plants take root, and where plants take root cattle find support through them, the sacrifice (finds support) in cattle, the sacrificer in the sacrifice, offspring in the sacrificer; therefore he pours water down, for support. If the Adhvaryu were to pour the libation on that which is without fire, the Adhvaryu would be [1] blind, the Raksases would destroy the sacrifice; he puts gold down and offers; verily he pours on what has fire, the Adhvaryu does not become blind, the Raksases do not destroy the sacrifice. &lsquo;I touch Agni with mind, with ghee&rsquo;, he says, for with mind man approaches the sacrifice; &lsquo;who lordeth it over all the worlds&rsquo;, he says, for he lords it over all; &lsquo;broad, vast, with pervading vital power&rsquo;, he says, for he born small becomes great [2]; &lsquo;most extensive, impetuous, winning food&rsquo;, he says; verily he makes pleasant food for him; all is pleasant for him who knows thus. &lsquo;I touch thee with speech, with ghee&rsquo;, he says; therefore what a man conceives with mind he utters with speech; &lsquo;with friendly (mind) he says, to smite away the Raksases; &lsquo;with mortal glory, with engaging colour, Agni&rsquo;, he says; verily he bestows beauty upon him; he is possessed of beauty who knows thus [3]. By mind must he obtain that libation which the Adhvaryu offers in that which is without fire; he offers with two verses containing the word &lsquo;mind&rsquo;, to obtain the two libations; with two (he offers), for support. As the beginning of the sacrifice is performed the Raksases are fain to destroy the sacrifice; now then is this (place) the beginning of the sacrifice when the libation comes upon it; he draws a line around, to smite away the Raksases; with three (verses) he draws a line around, Agni is threefold; verily from the whole extent of Agni he smites away the Raksases [4]; with a Gayatri verse he draws a line around, the Gayatri is brilliance; verily with brilliance, he encircles him; with a Tristubh verse he draws a line around, the Tristubh is power; verily he encircles him with power; with an Anustubh verse he draws a line around, the Anustubh, envelops all the metres, (verily it serves) for complete attainment; with the Anustubh in the middle (he draws), the Anustubh is speech, therefore from the middle we speak with speech; with the Gayatri first he draws, then with the Anustubh, then with the Tristubh; the Gayatri is brilliance, the Anustubh the sacrifice, the Tristubh power; verily he encircles the sacrifice, with brilliance and power, on both sides.</p>
<h4 id="04-26">04</h4>
<p>&lsquo;On the instigation of the god Savitr thee&rsquo;, (with these words) he digs, for instigation. Then with it he produces smoke; &lsquo;Full of light, thee, O Agni, of fair aspect&rsquo;, he says, and thereby he produces light. Agni on birth afflicted creatures with pain, him the gods appeased by the half-verse; &lsquo;auspicious and harmless to offspring&rsquo;, he says; verily he makes him appeased for offspring. He digs with two (verses), for support. &lsquo;Thou art the back of the waters&rsquo;, (with these words) he takes the lotus leaf [1]; the lotus leaf is the back of the waters; verily with its own form he takes it. He gathers with a lotus leaf; the lotus leaf is the birthplace of Agni; verily he gathers Agni with his own birthplace. He gathers with a black antelope skin; the black antelope skin is the sacrifice; verily he gathers the sacrifice with the sacrifice. If he were to gather with the skin of tame animals he would afflict with pain tame animals; he gathers with a black antelope skin; verily he afflicts with pain wild animals [2]; therefore of animals of even birth the wild animals are the smaller, for they are afflicted with pain. He gathers on the hairy side, for on that side is it pure. He strews the lotus leaf and the black antelope skin together; the black antelope skin is this (earth), the lotus leaf yonder (sky); verily on both sides he encircles him with these two. Agni departed from the gods, Atharvan perceived him; &lsquo;Atharvan first pressed thee out, O Agni&rsquo; [3], he says; verily he gathers him with him who perceived him. &lsquo;Thee, O Agni, from the lotus&rsquo;, he says, for in the lotus leaf he found him reposing. &lsquo;Thee the sage, Dadhyañc&rsquo;, he says; Dadhyañc, son of Atharvan, was full of brilliance; verily he bestows brilliance upon him. &lsquo;Thee Pathya Vrsan&rsquo;, he says; verily with the latter (verse) he hails him whom he has previously addressed [4]. He gathers with four (verses), the metres are four; verily (he gathers) with the metres. (He gathers) with Gayatri verses for a Brahman, for the Brahman is connected with the Gayatri; with Tristubh verses for a Rajanya, for the Rajanya is connected with the Tristubh; if he desire of a man, &lsquo;May he be richer&rsquo;, he should gather for him with both sets; verily upon him he bestows brilliance and power together. With eight (verses) he gathers; the Gayatri has eight syllables, Agni is connected with the Gayatri; verily he gathers all the extent of Agni. &lsquo;Sit thou, O Hotr&rsquo;, he says; verily he makes the deities sit down for him; &lsquo;The Hotr down&rsquo;, (with these words he makes) men (sit down); &lsquo;Sit thou down&rsquo;, (with these words he makes) birds (sit down); &lsquo;Be born noble in the forefront of the days&rsquo;, he says; verily he produces for him the common session of gods and men.</p>
<h4 id="05-26">05</h4>
<p>In that he digs he acts as it were harshly to this (earth); he pours water down, the waters are appeased; verily with the waters appeased he calms her pain. &lsquo;May for thee Vayu, Matariśvan unite&rsquo;, he says; Vayu is breath; verily with breath he unites her breath; &lsquo;may for thee Vayu&rsquo;, he says; therefore the rain speeds from the sky, made to fall by Vayu. &lsquo;To him, O goddess, be Vasat with thee&rsquo; [1], he says; the seasons are six; verily upon the seasons he bestows rain; therefore in all the seasons it rains. If he were to utter the Vasat cry, his Vasat cry would be exhausted; if he were not to utter the Vasat cry, the Raksases would destroy the sacrifice; &lsquo;Vat&rsquo;, he says; verily, mysteriously he utters the Vasat cry; his Vasat cry is not exhausted, the Raksases do not destroy the sacrifice. &lsquo;Well born with light&rsquo;, (with these words) he ties up with an Anustubh verse; all the metres are the Anustubh [2], Agni&rsquo;s dear body is the metres; verily he encircles him with his dear body; likely to win a garment is he who knows thus. Agni when tied up is connected with Varuna; &lsquo;Arise, thou of fair sacrifice&rsquo;, &lsquo;Arise, erect, to aid us&rsquo;, with two (verses) addressed to Savitr he rises up; verily, instigated by Savitr, he sends aloft the wrath of Varuna that is in him; with two (verses) (he arises), for support. &lsquo;Born, thou art the child [3] of the two worlds, he says; the two worlds are these two (sky and earth), Agni is the child of the two; therefore he says thus. &lsquo;O Agni, brilliant, distributed among the plants&rsquo;, he says, for when they distribute him, then he becomes more brilliant. &lsquo;Thou didst come thundering from thy mothers&rsquo;, he says; his mothers are the plants; verily from them he makes him to fall. &lsquo;Be firm, of strong limbs&rsquo;, (with these words) he places (Agni) on the ass [4]; verily thereby he yokes it for strength. He gathers with the ass; therefore the ass is the best burden gatherer of animals. He gathers with the ass; therefore the ass, even when grazing is bad, becomes fat beyond other animals, for by it they gather food and light. He gathers with the ass; therefore the ass, being of double seed, is born as the least of animals, for Agni burns his place of birth. Now he is mounted upon offspring [5], and is strong to burn with pain offspring. &lsquo;Be auspicious, for offspring&rsquo;, he says; verily he makes him calm for offspring. &lsquo;(For offspring) of man, O Angiras&rsquo;, he says, for offspring are of men. &lsquo;Scorch not sky and earth, nor the atmosphere, nor the trees&rsquo;, he says; verily he makes him calm for these worlds. &lsquo;Let the steed advance, thundering&rsquo;, he says, for he is a steed. &lsquo;The sounding, the donkey, the flier&rsquo; [6], he says, for the seers called him the &lsquo;donkey&rsquo;. &lsquo;Bearing Agni of the dust&rsquo;, he says, for he bears Agni. &lsquo;May he fall not before his day&rsquo;, he says; verily he bestows life upon him; therefore an ass lives all its days; therefore are men afraid when an ass perishes before its day. &lsquo;The strong, bearing the strong Agni&rsquo;, he says, for he is strong, and Agni is strong. &lsquo;Germ of the waters [7], him of the ocean&rsquo;, he says, for Agni is the germ of the waters. &lsquo;O Agni, come hither for enjoyment&rsquo;, (at these words) the two worlds burst apart; in that he says, &lsquo;O Agni, come hither for enjoyment&rsquo;, it is for the separation (vityai) of these worlds. He, having left his place and not having reached a support, then thinks of the Adhvaryu and the sacrificer; &lsquo;holy order and truth&rsquo;, he says; holy order is this (earth), truth [8] is yonder (sky); verily in these two he establishes him, and neither the Adhvaryu nor the sacrificer is ruined. Agni when tied up, as Varuna, attacks the sacrificer; &lsquo;O plants, do ye accept Agni here&rsquo;, he says, for atonement. &lsquo;Casting aside all hostilities, all evil imaginings&rsquo;, he says, to smite away the Raksases. &lsquo;Sitting down, may he smite away from us misfortune&rsquo;, he says, for support. &lsquo;O plants, do ye rejoice [9] in him&rsquo;, he says; Agni&rsquo;s portion is the plants; verily he unites him with them. &lsquo;Rich in flowers and having fair leaves&rsquo;, he says; therefore plants produce fruit. &lsquo;This germ of yours, of due season, hath sat him in his ancient seat&rsquo;, he says; verily in those he establishes them from whom he makes him to fall. With two verses he deposits (it), for support.</p>
<h4 id="06-26">06</h4>
<p>Agni when tied up is connected with Varuna; &lsquo;With extending blaze&rsquo;, (with these words) he unloosens (him); verily, instigated by Savitr, he lets loose on all sides the wrath of Varuna that is in him. He pours water down; the waters are appeased; verily by the waters appeased he calms his pain; with three (verses) he pours (it) down, Agni is three fold; verily he calms Agni&rsquo;s pain throughout his whole extent. &lsquo;Mitra having united the earth&rsquo;, he says; Mitra is the auspicious one of the gods; verily [1] with him he unites him, for atonement. If he were to unite him with sherds of domestic pots, he would afflict domestic pots with pain; he unites (him) with fragments of broken pots; these are not used for life; verily he afflicts them with pain. He unites (him) with sand, for support, and for healing. He unites (him) with goat-hair; the female goat is Agni&rsquo;s dear form; verily he unites him with his dear form, and thus with brilliance. He unites him with the hairs of a black antelope skin [2]; the black antelope skin is the sacrifice; verily he unites the sacrifice with the sacrifice. &lsquo;The Rudras, having gathered together the earth&rsquo;, he says; these deities first gathered him together; verily with them he gathers him together. &lsquo;Thou art the head of Makha&rsquo;, he says; Makha is the sacrifice, the firepan is his head; therefore he says thus. &lsquo;Ye are the two feet of the sacrifice&rsquo;, he says, for these are the two feet of the sacrifice [3]; and also (it serves) for support. He hands (the pan) over with one set (of verses), and addresses it with another, to make a pairing. He makes it with a triple stand; these worlds are three; (verily it serves) to obtain these worlds. He makes (it) with the metres; the metres are strength; verily he makes it with strength. He makes a hole with a Yajus, for discrimination. He makes it so great, of equal girth with Prajapati, the beginning of the sacrifice. He makes it with two breasts, for the milking of sky and earth; he makes it of four breasts, for the milking of cattle; he makes it of eight breasts, for the milking of the metres. For him who practises witchcraft he should make it nine cornered; verily gathering together the threefold thunderbolt he hurls it at his foe, to lay him low. &lsquo;Having made the great pan&rsquo;, (with these words) he deposits (it); verily he establishes it among the deities.</p>
<h4 id="07-25">07</h4>
<p>With seven (verses) he fumigates; the breaths in the head are seven, the pan is the head of the sacrifice; verily he places the breaths in the head of the sacrifice; therefore seven are the breaths in the head. He fumigates with horse-dung; the horse is connected with Prajapati; (verily it serves) to connect it with its place of birth. &lsquo;May Aditi thee&rsquo;, he says; Aditi is this (earth); verily with Aditi in Aditi he digs, to avoid injury to it, for one hurts not oneself. &lsquo;May the wives of the gods thee&rsquo;, he says; the wives of the gods made it first [1]; verily with them he places it. &lsquo;May the Dhisanas thee&rsquo;,</p>
<p>thee&rsquo;, he says; the women are the wives of the gods [2]; verily with them he cooks it. With six (verses) he cooks; the seasons are six; verily with the seasons he cooks it. &lsquo;May they cook&rsquo;, he says twice; therefore twice in the year does the corn ripen. The pan when enkindled is connected with Varuna; he approaches it with (a verse) addressed to Mitra, for atonement. &lsquo;May the god Savitr dig thee out&rsquo;, he says; verily, instigated by Savitr, he digs it out with holy power and with the deities. &lsquo;Breaking not, O earth, fill the regions, the quarters&rsquo; [3], he says; therefore Agni shines along all the quarters. &lsquo;Arise, become great, stand upright, be thou firm&rsquo;, he says, for support. A bowl that is not poured upon is connected with the Asuras; he pours upon it; verily he makes it to be with the gods; with goats&rsquo; milk he pours upon it; the milk of the goat is the highest form of draught; verily he pours upon it with the highest draught; (he pours) with a Yajus, for discrimination. He pours with the metres; with the metres it is made; verily with the metres he pours upon the metres.</p>
<h4 id="08-24">08</h4>
<p>With twenty-one beans he approaches the head of the man; beans are impure, the man&rsquo;s head is impure; verily by the impure he redeems its impurity and making it pure takes it. There are twenty one; man is composed of twenty-one parts; (verily they serve) to obtain man. The man&rsquo;s head is impure as bereft of the breaths; he deposits (it near) an ant-heap pierced in seven places; the breaths in the head are seven; verily he unites it with the breaths, to make it pure. Of all those [1] that were comrades of death Yama holds the overlordship; he sings the verses of Yama; verily from Yama he redeems it; with three he sings; three are these worlds; verily from these worlds he redeems it; therefore one should not give to one who sings, for the Gatha appropriates it. To the fires he offers animals; the fires are desires; verily he wins his desires. If he were not to offer the animals, then he would not obtain animals [2]; if he were to let them go after circumambulation with fire, he would disturb the sacrifice; if he were to keep them until the conclusion, the heads would be exhausted; in that he offers the animals, he wins thereby animals; in that he lets them go after circumambulation with fire, (it serves) to prevent the exhaustion of the heads; he concludes (the rite) with (an animal) for Prajapati; Prajapati is the sacrifice; verily he concludes the sacrifice in the sacrifice. Prajapati created offspring, he thought himself empty, he saw these April (verses), with them from the head [3] he satisfied himself. In that there are these April verses, and Prajapati is the sacrifice, he satisfies the sacrifice from the beginning with them. They are of unlimited metres; Prajapati is unlimited; (verily they serve) to obtain Prajapati. The pairs are deficient and redundant, for propagation; hairy by name is that metre of Prajapati, animals are hairy; verily he wins animals. There are all forms in these; all forms are made when Agni has to be piled up, therefore these appertain to Agni, to be piled [4]. Twenty-one kindling-(verses) be repeats; the twenty-onefold (Stoma) is light; verily he attains light, and a support besides, for the twenty-one fold (Stoma) is support. Twenty-four (verses) he recites; the year has twenty-four half-months, Agni Vaiśvanara is the year; verily straightway he wins Vaiśvanara. He recites them straight on, for the world of heaven is as it were going straight away. &lsquo;Let the half-years, the seasons, increase thee, O Agni &lsquo;, he says; verily with the half-years he causes Agni to increase [5], with the seasons the year. &lsquo;Illuminate all the quarters of the earth&rsquo;, he says; therefore Agni illuminates all the quarters. &lsquo;The Aśvins removed death from him&rsquo;, he says; verily from him he repels death. &lsquo;We from the darkness&rsquo;, he says; the darkness is the evil one; verily from him he smites away the evil one. &lsquo;We have come to the highest light&rsquo;, he says; the highest light is yonder sun; verily he attains unity with the sun. The year lags not, his future fails not, for whom these are performed. The last he recites with the word &lsquo;light&rsquo; in it; verily he bestows on him light above, to reveal the world of heaven.</p>
<h4 id="09-25">09</h4>
<p>With six (verses) he consecrates; the seasons are six; verily he consecrates him with the seasons. With seven he consecrates; the metres are seven; verily he consecrates him with the metres. &lsquo;Let every man of the god that leads&rsquo;, with the final Anustubh he offers; the Anustubh is speech;</p>
<p>therefore speech is the highest of the breaths. The first quarter foot is deficient by one syllable; therefore men live upon the incomplete part of speech. He offers with a full (one), for Prajapati is full as it were; (verily it serves) to obtain Prajapati [1]; he offers with one that is deficient, for from the deficient Prajapati created offspring; (verily it serves) for the creation of offspring. If he were to heat it on the flame, he would win what has been, if on the embers, what is to be; he heats it on the embers; verily he wins what is to be, for what is to be is greater than what has been. With two verses he heats (it); the sacrificer has two feet; (verily it serves) for support. The pan is gathered together with holy power and the Yajus; if it should break, the sacrificer would be ruined [2], and his sacrifice destroyed. &lsquo;O Mitra, do thou heat this pan&rsquo;, he says; Mitra is holy power; verily on holy power he establishes it; the sacrificer is not ruined, nor is his sacrifice destroyed. If it should break, he should unite it with the selfsame potsherds; that is the atonement for it. If a man has attained prosperity, he should for him deposit (the fire) after producing it by friction; this is one that has succeeded; verily he approaches his own deity [3]. For him who desires prosperity should be used (the fire) which comes to life from the pan, for from it is it produced, it is self-produced by name; verily he becomes prosperous. If he desire of a man, &lsquo;May I produce a foe for him&rsquo;, he should take for him (fire) from elsewhere, and deposit it; verily straightway he produces a foe for him. From a frying-pan he should (take fire) and deposit (it) for one who desires food; in a frying-pan food is kept; verily he wins food with its birth place [4]. He deposits Muñja grass; Muñja is strength; verily he bestows upon him strength. Agni departed from the gods, he entered the Krumuka wood; he deposits Krumuka; verily he wins what of Agni is there imbued. With butter he joins (it); butter is the dear home of Agni; verily he unites him with his dear abode, and with brilliance also [5]. He puts on (a stick) of Vikankata wood; verily he wins radiance; he puts on one of Çami, for atonement. &lsquo;Do thou sit down in the lap of this mother&rsquo;, with three (verses) he adores (the fire) when born; three are these worlds; verily he attains reputation in these worlds; verily also he bestows breaths on himself.</p>
<h4 id="10-24">10</h4>
<p>Formerly Agni would not burn what was not cut by the axe, but Prayoga, the seer, made that acceptable to him. &lsquo;Whatever logs we place on thee&rsquo;, (with these words) he puts on a kindling-stick; verily he makes what is not cut by the axe acceptable to him; all is acceptable to him who knows thus. He puts on one of Udumbara wood; the Udumbara is strength; verily he confers strength upon him. Prajapati created Agni; him on creation the Raksases [1] were fain to destroy; he saw that (hymn) of the Raksas-slaying (one); therewith he smote away the Raksases; in that it is (the hymn) of the Raksas-slaying one, thereby he drives away the Raksases from Agni when born. He puts on one of Aśvattha wood; of trees the Aśvattha is the overcomer of foes; (verily it serves) for victory. He puts on one of Vikankata; verily he wins light. He puts on one of Çami wood, for atonement. &lsquo;Sharpened is my holy power&rsquo;, &lsquo;Their arms have I uplifted&rsquo;, (with these words) he makes him speak over the last two Udumbara (sticks) [2]; verily by means of the holy power he quickens the kingly power, and by the kingly power the holy power; therefore a Brahman who has a princely person is superior to another Brahman; therefore a prince who has a Brahman is superior to another prince. Now Agni is death, gold is immortality; he puts a gold plate within; verily he severs immortality from death; it has twenty-one projections, the worlds of the gods are twenty-one, the twelve months, the four seasons, these three worlds, and as twenty-first yonder sun [3]; so many are the worlds of the gods; verily from them he severs his foe. By means of the projections the gods reduced the Asuras to straits (nirbadé); that is the reason why projections (nirbadháh) have their names; it is covered with projections; verily he reduces his foes to straits. He puts (it) on with a verse addressed to Savitr, for instigation. &lsquo;Night and the dawn&rsquo;, with (this as) second; verily he raises him with day and night. &lsquo;The gods, granters of wealth, support Agni&rsquo;, be says; the gods, granters of wealth, are the breaths; verily having raised him with day and night [4] he supports him with the breaths. Sitting he puts (it) on; therefore offspring are born sitting; the black antelope skin is above; gold is brilliance, the black antelope skin is holy power; verily on both sides he encircles him, with brilliance and with holy power. The sling is of six fathoms in extent; the seasons are six; verily he raises him with the seasons; if it is of twelve fathoms, (he raises him) with the year. It is of Muñja grass; the Muñja is strength; verily he unites him with strength. &lsquo;Thou art the bird of fair feathers&rsquo;, (with these words) he gazes; verily he declares his greatness in that form. &lsquo;Go to the sky, fly to the heaven&rsquo;, he says; verily he makes him to go to the world of heaven.<br>

<p>Headed by Visnu the gods won finally these worlds by the metres; in that he strides the strides of Visnu, the sacrificer becoming Visnu wins finally these worlds. &lsquo;Thou art the step of Visnu, overcoming hostility&rsquo;, he says; the earth is connected with the Gayatri, the atmosphere with the Tristubh, the sky with the Jagati, the quarters with the Anustubh; verily he wins in order these worlds with the metres. Prajapati created Agni; he being created went away from him [1]; he followed him with this (verse), &lsquo;He hath cried&rsquo;; with it he won the home dear to Agni; in that he repeats this (verse), he wins thereby the home dear to Agni. Now he who steps the strides of Visnu is apt as he goes away to be burnt up; he turns with four (verses); the. metres are four, Agni&rsquo;s dear body is the metres; verily he turns round on his dear body [2]; he turns round from left to right; verily he turns round on his own strength; therefore the right side of the body is the stronger; verily also does he turn with the turning of the sun. Varuna seized Çunahśepa Ajigarti, he saw this verse addressed to Varuna, by it he freed himself from the noose of Varuna; Varuna seizes him who takes the fire-pan; &lsquo;From us the highest knot, O Varuna&rsquo;, he says; verily thereby he frees himself from Varuna&rsquo;s noose [3]. &lsquo;I have drawn thee&rsquo;, he says, for he draws him. &lsquo;Be thou firm and motionless&rsquo;, he says, for support. &lsquo;Let all the folk desire thee&rsquo;, he says; verily with the folk he unites him. &lsquo;In him establish the kingdom&rsquo;, he says; verily in him he makes the kingdom to abide. If he desire of a man, &lsquo;May he be a ruler&rsquo;, he should think of him with his mind; verily he becomes a ruler [4]. &lsquo;In greatness he hath risen erect in the van of the dawns&rsquo;, he says; verily he makes him the first of his peers. &lsquo;Emerging from the darkness&rsquo;, he says; verily he smites away darkness from him. &lsquo;He hath come with the light&rsquo;, he says; verily he bestows light upon him. He places him with four (verses); the metres are four; verily with the metres (he places him); with an Atichandas as the last; the Atichandas is the highest of metres; verily he makes him the highest of his peers; it contains [5] the word &lsquo;sit&rsquo; (sad); verily he makes him attain reality (sat-tvám). With (the hymn) of Vatsapri he reverences (him); by that did Vatsapri Bhalandana win the home dear to Agni; verily by it he wins the home dear to Agni. It has eleven (verses); verily in eleven places he bestows strength on the sacrificer. By the Stoma the gods prospered in this world, by the metres in yonder world; the hymn of Vatsapri is the type of the Stoma; in that he pays reverence with (the hymn) of Vatsapri [6], he wins with it this world; in that he strides the steps of Visnu, he wins by them yonder world. On the first day he strides forth, on the next day he pays reverence; therefore the minds of some creatures are set on energy, those of others on rest; therefore the active lords it over him who takes his ease therefore the active fixes upon a man who takes his ease. He clenches his fist, he restrains his speech, for support.</p>
<h4 id="02-25">02</h4>
<p>&lsquo;O lord of food, accord us food&rsquo;, he says; the lord of food is Agni; verily he grants him food. &lsquo;Uninjurious, impetuous&rsquo;, he says; he means in fact &lsquo;free from disease&rsquo;. &lsquo;Do thou further the donor, bestow strength on our bipeds, our quadrupeds&rsquo;, he says; verily he invokes this blessing. &lsquo;May the All-gods bear thee up&rsquo;, he says; the All-gods are the breaths [1]; verily with the breaths he raises him. &lsquo;O Agni, with their thoughts&rsquo;, he says; with the purpose for which he raises him, he verily unites him. He places (him) with four (verses); the metres are four; verily with the metres (he places him); with an Atichandas as the last; the Atichandas is the highest of the metres; verily he makes him the highest of his peers; it contains the word &lsquo;sit&rsquo; (sad); verily he makes him attain reality (sat tvám). &lsquo;Come forward, O Agni, rich in light&rsquo; [2], he says; verily he bestows light upon him. With his body he injures him whom he injures; &lsquo;Harm not our offspring with thy body&rsquo;, he says; verily for his offspring he makes him gentle. The Raksases infest that sacrifice where the axle creaks; &lsquo;He hath cried&rsquo;, he repeats, to smite away the Raksases. They bear (him) with a cart; verily he confers honour upon him; therefore he that has a cart and he that has a chariot are of guests [3] the most honoured: honour is his who knows thus. &lsquo;With kindling-wood serve Agni&rsquo;, (with these words) he puts a kindling-stick, made wet with ghee, upon him when put in place; that is as when hospitality with melted butter is offered to a guest on arrival; (he puts it on) with a Gayatri for a Brahman, for the Brahman is connected with the Gayatri, with a Tristubh for a Rajanya, for the Rajanya is connected with the Tristubh. He casts the ash into the waters; Agni&rsquo;s place of birth is in the waters; verily he</p>
<p>makes him attain his own place of birth; with three (verses) he casts (it); Agni is threefold [4]; verily he makes Agni attain support through all his extent. Now he casts away Agni who puts the ash into the waters; he places it (in the pan) with (verses) containing the word &lsquo;light&rsquo;; verily he bestows light upon him; with two (he places it), for support. He throws away offspring and cattle who puts the ash in the waters; &lsquo;Return with strength&rsquo;, &lsquo;With wealth&rsquo;, (with these words) he comes back; verily he bestows upon himself offspring and cattle. &lsquo;May the Adityas [5], the Rudras, the Vasus kindle thee again&rsquo;, he says; these deities first kindled him; verily by them he kindles him. &lsquo;Hearken&rsquo;, &lsquo;Be thou&rsquo;, (with these words) he pays reverence; verily he awakens him; therefore after sleeping creatures awake. In his place he pays reverence, and therefore cattle returning go to their place.</p>
<h4 id="03-26">03</h4>
<p>Yama holds the overlordship of the whole extent of earth; he who without asking from Yama a place of it for divine sacrifice piles up the fire is piling it for Yama. &lsquo;Go hence&rsquo;, (with these words) he makes him fix (on the place); verily having asked from Yama a place of it for divine sacrifice, he piles the fire for himself. Seeking they could not find so much as an arrow point of it which was not covered with death; the gods saw this Yajus, &lsquo;Go hence&rsquo;; in that he makes him fix with this [1], he piles the fire on a place freed from death. He throws up (the earth); verily he smites away any impurity in it; he sprinkles water on, for atonement. He puts down sand; that is the form of Agni Vaiśvanara; verily by his form he wins Vaiśvanara. He puts down salt; salt is the nourishment and the propagating; verily he piles the fire in nourishment, in propagation, and also in concord; for the salt is the concord [2] of cattle. Sky and earth were together; separating they said, &lsquo;Let us share together what is worthy of sacrifice&rsquo;. What of yonder (sky) was worthy of sacrifice, it placed in this (earth), that became salt; what of this (earth) was worthy of sacrifice, it placed in yonder (sky) and that is yonder black in the moon; when he puts down the salt he should think of yonder (black); verily he piles the fire in that of sky and earth which is worthy of sacrifice. &lsquo;This is that Agni&rsquo; is Viśvamitra&rsquo;s [3] hymn; by that Viśvamitra won the abode dear to Agni; verily by it he wins the abode dear to Agni. By the metres the gods went to the world of heaven; he places four (bricks) pointing east the metres are four; verily by the metres the sacrificer goes to the world of heaven. As they went to the world of heaven, the quarters were confused; they put down two in front, facing the same way, and two [4] behind, facing the same way; by them they made firm the quarters. In that he places two in front, facing the same way, and two behind, facing the same way, (it serves) to make firm the quarters; again, the metres are cattle; verily he makes cattle available for him. He places eight (bricks); the Gayatri has eight syllables, Agni is connected with the Gayatri; verily he piles Agni in his full extent. He places eight; the Gayatri has eight syllables; the Gayatri knows in truth the world of heaven; (verily it serves) to reveal the world of heaven [5]. He places thirteen world fillers; they make twenty-one, the twenty-onefold Stoma is a support, the Garhapatya is a support, verily he finds support in the support of the twenty-onefold (Stoma), the Garhapatya; he who knows thus finds support in the fire which he has piled. He who first piles (the fire) should pile in five layers; the sacrifice is fivefold, cattle are fivefold; verily he wins the sacrifice and cattle. He who piles for a second time should pile in three layers; these worlds are three; verily he finds support [6] in these worlds. He who piles for a third time should pile in one layer; the world of heaven is in one place; verily he goes to the world of heaven by the single (layer). He makes (them) firm with mortar; therefore the bone is covered with meat; he who knows thus does not become diseased of skin. There are five layers, he makes firm with five (sets of) dust; they make up ten, the Viraj has ten syllables, the Viraj is food; verily he finds support in the Viraj, in proper food.</p>
<h4 id="04-27">04</h4>
<p>The Agni that was before and the one in the fire-pan are at variance; &lsquo;Be united&rsquo;, with four (verses) he unites them together; the metres are four, Agni&rsquo;s dear body is the metres; verily with his dear body he puts them in order. &lsquo;Be united, he says; therefore the kingly power unites with the holy power; in that after uniting (them) he separates (them), therefore the holy power separates from the kingly power. With the seasons [1] they consecrate him; with the seasons likewise he must be set</p>
<p>free; &lsquo;As a mother her son, the earth Agni of the dust&rsquo;, he says; verily having consecrated him with the seasons, with the season he sets him free. With (a verse) addressed to Vaiśvanara, he takes the sling; verily he makes it ready. For Nirrti there are three (bricks) black, dried by a chaff fire; chaff is the portion of Nirrti, black is the form of Nirrti; verily by her own form he propitiates Nirrti. They go to this quarter; this [2] is the quarter of Nirrti; verily in her own quarter he propitiates Nirrti. He places (it) in a self-made hole or a cleft; that is the abode of Nirrti; verily he propitiates Nirrti in her own abode. He places (them) over against the sling, the noose is connected with Nirrti; verily he frees him straightway from the noose of Nirrti. He places three, man is threefold in arrangement; verily he removes by sacrifice Nirrti from the whole extent of man. He places them going away (from the place of sacrifice); verily he drives away Nirrti from him [3]. They return without looking round, to conceal Nirrti. Having purified, they pay reverence, for purity. To the Garhapatya they pay reverence; verily having wandered in the world of Nirrti, they return, purified, to the world of the gods. They pay reverence with one (verse); verily in one place they bestow strength on the sacrificer. &lsquo;Abode and collector of riches&rsquo;, he says; rich are offspring and cattle; verily he unites him with offspring and cattle.</p>
<h4 id="05-27">05</h4>
<p>With man&rsquo;s measure he metes out; man is commensurate with the sacrifice; verily he metes him with a member of the sacrifice; so great is he as a man with arms extended; so much strength is there in man; verily with strength he metes him. Winged is he, for wingless he could not fly; these wings are longer by an ell; therefore birds have strength by their wings. The wings and the tail are a fathom in breadth; so much is the strength in man [1], he is commensurate in strength. He metes with a bamboo; the bamboo is connected with Agni; (verily it serves) to unite him with his birthplace. With a Yajus he yokes (the team), with a Yajus he ploughs, for discrimination. He ploughs with a (team) of six oxen; the seasons are six; verily with the seasons he ploughs him. In that (he ploughs) with (a team) of twelve oxen, (he ploughs) with the year. This (earth) was afraid of excessive burning by Agni; she saw this of two sorts, ploughed and unploughed [2], then indeed he did not burn her excessively; in that there is ploughed and unploughed, (it serves to prevent) her being excessively burned. &lsquo;He should restrain Agni when twofold&rsquo;, they say; in that there is ploughed and unploughed (it serves) to restrain Agni. So many are animals, bipeds and quadrupeds; if he were to let them loose to the east, he would give them over to Rudra; if to the south, he would deliver them to the Pitrs; if to the west, the Raksases would destroy them; to the north he let them loose; this is the auspicious quarter of gods and men (3); verily he lets them loose in that direction. Again he lets them loose to this quarter, the breath is yonder sun: verily he lets them loose following the breath. From left to right they turn, around their own strength they turn; therefore the right side of the body is the stronger; verily they turn with the turning of the sun. Therefore cattle depart from (us), and come back towards (us). Three by three he ploughs the furrows [4]; verily he extends the threefold (Stoma) in the beginning of the sacrifice. He scatters plants, by holy power he wins food, in the Arka the Arka is piled. With fourteen verses he scatters; the domesticated plants are seven, the wild are seven; (verily they serve) to win both sets. He scatters (seeds) of diverse kinds of food, to win diverse foods. He scatters on the ploughed (ground), for in the ploughed plants find support. He scatters along the furrows, for propagation. In twelve furrows he scatters; the year has twelve months; verily with the year he cooks food for him. If he who piles the fire [5] should eat of what has not been obtained, he would be separated from what has been obtained. Those trees which bear fruit he should sprinkle in the kindling-wood, to obtain what has not been obtained. From the quarters he gathers clods; verily winning the strength of the quarters, he piles the fire in the strength of the quarters; he should take a clod from the quarter where is he whom he hates, (saying), &lsquo;Food and strength do I take hence&rsquo;, verily he wins from that quarter food and strength, and hungry is he who is in that quarter. He scatters over the high altar, for on the high altar is the fire piled; the high altar is cattle; verily he wins cattle; (verily it serves) for the avoidance of passing over a limb of the sacrifice.</p>
<h4 id="06-27">06</h4>
<p>&lsquo;O Agni, strength and fame are thine&rsquo;, (with these words) he scatters sand; that is the hymn of Agni Vaiśvanara; verily with the hymn he wins (Agni) Vaiśvanara. With six (verses) he scatters; the year has six seasons, Agni Vaiśvanara is the year; verily straightway he wins Vaiśvanara. This metre is called the ocean; offspring are born like the ocean; in that he scatters sand with this (hymn), (it is) for the propagation of offspring. Indra [1] hurled his bolt at Vrtra; it parted into three, one third the wooden sword, one-third the chariot, one-third the sacrificial post; the interior reeds which were crushed became gravel; that is the explanation of gravel; gravel is a thunderbolt, the fire is an animal; in that he supports the fire with gravel, he encircles with the bolt cattle for him; therefore cattle are encircled with the bolt; therefore the stronger does not receive the weaker. He should support (the fire) with twenty-one (pieces of gravel) for one who desires cattle [2]; there are seven breaths in the head, cattle are the breaths; verily he wins cattle for him by the breaths. With twenty seven (should he support it) for one who has foes; thus making the threefold bolt he hurls it at his foe, to lay him low. He should support (it) with unnumbered ones, to win what is unnumbered. If he desire of a man, &lsquo;May he be without cattle&rsquo;, then without piling the gravel in support, he should separate the sand; verily he pours forth for him the seed on all sides in (a place) not encircled; verily he becomes without cattle [3]. If he desire of a man, &lsquo;May he be rich in cattle,&rsquo; he should separate the sand, after piling the gravel; verily he pours forth for him the seed in one direction in an encircled (place), and he becomes rich in cattle. With (a verse) addressed to Soma he separates (the sand); Soma is impregnator of seed; verily he impregnates seed; with a Gayatri for a Brahman, for the Brahman is connected with the Gayatri, with a Tristubh for a Rajanya, for the Rajanya is connected with the Tristubh. To Çamyu, son of Brhaspati, the sacrifice did not resort; it entered the fire [4]; it departed from the fire in the form of a black antelope, it entered the horse, it became the intermediate hoof of the horse; in that he makes the horse advance, he wins the sacrifice which has entered the horse. &lsquo;By Prajapati must the fire be piled&rsquo;, they say; the horse is connected with Prajapati; in that he makes the horse advance, by Prajapati he piles the fire. He puts down a lotus leaf; the lotus leaf is the birthplace of the fire; verily he piles the fire with its own birthplace. &lsquo;Thou art the back of the waters&rsquo;, (with these words) he puts (it) down; the lotus leaf is the back of the waters; verily with its form he puts it down.</p>
<h4 id="07-26">07</h4>
<p>&lsquo;The holy power born&rsquo;, (with these words) he puts down the gold disk. Prajapati created creatures with the Brahman class as first; verily the sacrificer creates offspring with the Brahman as first; &lsquo;the holy power born&rsquo;, he says; therefore the Brahman is the first; the first he becomes who knows thus. The theologians say, &lsquo;Nor on earth, nor in the atmosphere, nor on sky should the fire be piled&rsquo;; if he were to pile (it) on earth, he would afflict the earth with pain; nor trees, nor plants would [1] be born; if he should pile (it) in the atmosphere, he would afflict the atmosphere with pain, the birds would not be born; if he should pile (it) in the sky, he would afflict the sky with pain, Parjanya would not rain. He puts down a gold disk; gold is immortality; verily in immortality he piles the fire, for propagation. He puts down a golden man, to support the world of the sacrificer; if he were to put it over the perforation in the brick, he would obstruct the breath of cattle and of the sacrificer; he puts it down on the south side [2] with head to the east: he supports the world of the sacrificer; he does not obstruct the breath of cattle and the sacrificer. Or rather he does place it over the perforation of the brick, to allow the breath to pass out. &lsquo;The drop hath fallen&rsquo;, (with these words) he touches it; verily he establishes it in the Hotr&rsquo;s offices. He puts down two ladles, one made of Karsmarya and full of butter, one of Udumbara and full of curds; that made of Karsmarya is this (earth), that of Udumbara is yonder (sky); verily he deposits these two (earth and sky) [3]. In silence he puts (them) down, for he should not obtain them with a Yajus; the Karsmarya on the south, the Udumbara on the north; therefore is yonder (sky) higher than this (earth); the Karsmarya filled with butter, the butter is a thunderbolt, the Karsmarya is a thunderbolt; verily by the thunderbolt he smites away the Raksases from the south of the sacrifice; the Udumbara filled with curds, curds are cattle, the Udumbara is strength; verily he confers strength upon cattle. He puts (them) down filled; verily filled they wait on him [4] in yonder world. &lsquo;In the Viraj should the fire be piled&rsquo;, they say; the Viraj is the ladle; in that he puts down two ladles, he piles Agni in the Viraj. As each beginning of the sacrifice is being performed, the Raksases seek to destroy the sacrifice; the golden disk is a</p>
<p>beginning of the sacrifice; in that he pours butter over the gold disk, he smites away the Raksases from the beginning of the sacrifice. With five (verses) he pours butter; the sacrifice is fivefold; verily he smites away the Raksases from the whole extent of the sacrifice; he pours butter transversely; therefore animals move their limbs transversely, for support.</p>
<h4 id="08-25">08</h4>
<p>He puts down the naturally perforated brick; the naturally perforated brick is this (earth); verily he puts down the (earth). He makes the horse sniff it; verily he bestows breath upon it; now the horse is connected with Prajapati; verily he piles the fire with Prajapati. The first brick that is put down obstructs the breath of cattle and of the sacrificer; it is a naturally perforated one, to permit the breath to pass, and also to reveal the world of heaven. &lsquo;In the fire must the fire be piled&rsquo;, they say; the Brahman [1] is Agni Vaiśvanara, and to him should he hand over the first brick over which a Yajus has been recited; with the Brahman he should deposit it; verily in the fire he piles the fire. Now he who ignorantly puts down a brick is liable to experience misfortune. Three boons should he give, the breaths are three; (verily they serve) to guard the breaths; two only should be given, for the breaths are two; one only should be given, for the breath is one. The fire is an animal here [2]; animals do not find pleasure in want of grass; a brick of Durva grass he puts down, to support animals; with two (verses), for support. &lsquo;Arising from every stem&rsquo;, he says, for it finds support with every stem; &lsquo;do thou, O Durva, extend us with a thousand, a hundred&rsquo;, he says; Prajapati is connected with a thousand; (verily it serves) to obtain Prajapati. The fact that it has three lines on it is a mark of the gods; the gods put it down with the mark uppermost, the Asuras with the mark undermost [3]; if he desire of a man, &lsquo;May he become richer&rsquo;, he should put it down for him mark uppermost; verily he becomes richer; if he desire of a man, &lsquo;May he become worse off&rsquo;, he should put his down mark undermost; verily he makes him depressed in accordance with its birthplace among the Asuras, and he becomes worse off. (The brick) has three lines on it; that with three lines is these worlds; verily he excludes its foe from these worlds. When the Angirases went to the world of heaven, the sacrificial cake becoming a tortoise crawled after them [4]; in that he puts down a tortoise, just as one who knows a place leads straight (to it), so the tortoise leads him straight to the world of heaven. The tortoise is the intelligence of animals; in that he puts down the tortoise, animals resort there, seeing their own intelligence; in that the heads of the dead animals are deposited, a burial-ground is made; in that he puts down the living tortoise, he is no maker of a burial-ground, the tortoise is suitable for a dwelling [5]. &lsquo;To the pious the winds honey&rsquo;, (with these words) he anoints with curds, mixed with honey; verily he makes him ready; curds is a food of the village, honey of the wild; in that he anoints with curds mixed with honey, (it serves) to win both. &lsquo;May the two great ones, heaven and earth&rsquo;, he says; verily with them he encircles him on both sides. He puts it down to the east,&rsquo; to attain the world of heaven; he puts it down to the east facing west; therefore [6] to the east facing west the animals attend the sacrifice. If he piles the fire without a navel, (the fire) enters the navel of the sacrificer, and is liable to injure him. He puts down the mortar; this is the navel of the fire; verily he piles the fire with its navel, to avoid injury. (The mortar) is of Udumbara wood; the Udumbara is strength; verily he wins strength; in the middle he puts it down; verily in the middle he bestows strength upon him; therefore in the middle men enjoy strength. So large is it, commensurate with Prajapati, the mouth of the sacrifice. He pounds; verily he makes food; he puts (it) down with (a verse) addressed to Visnu; the sacrifice is Visnu, the trees are connected with Visnu; verily in the sacrifice he establishes the sacrifice.</p>
<h4 id="09-26">09</h4>
<p>The pan is the concentrated light of these lights; in that he puts down the pan, verily he wins the light from these worlds; in the middle he puts (it) down; verily he bestows upon it light; therefore in the middle we reverence the light; with sand he fills (it); that is the form of Agni Vaiśvanara; verily by his form he wins Vaiśvanara. If he desire of a man, &lsquo;May he become hungry&rsquo;, he should put down for one (a pan) deficient in size [1]; if he desire of a man, &lsquo;May he eat food that fails not&rsquo;, he should put it down full; verily he eats food that fails not. The man accords a thousand of cattle, the other animals a thousand; in the middle he puts down the head of the man, to give it strength. In the</p>
<p>pan he puts (it) down; verily he makes it attain support; the head of the man is impure as devoid of breaths; the breaths are immortality [2], gold is immortality; on the (organs of the) breaths he hurls chips of gold; verily he makes it attain support, and unites it with the breaths. He fills (it) with curds mixed with honey, (saying) &lsquo;May I be fit to drink honey&rsquo;; (he fills with curds) to be curdled with hot milk, for purity. The curds are the food of the village, honey of the wild; in that he fills (it) with curds mixed with honey, (it serves) to win both. He puts down the heads of the animals; the heads of the animals are cattle; verily he wins cattle. If he desire of a man, &lsquo;May he have no cattle&rsquo;[3], he should put them down, looking away, for him; verily he makes cattle look away from him; he becomes without cattle. If he desire of a man, &lsquo;May he be rich in cattle&rsquo;, he should put (them) down looking with (the man&rsquo;s head); verily he makes the cattle look with him; he becomes rich in cattle. He puts (the head) of the horse in the east looking west, that of the bull in the west looking east; the beasts other than the oxen and the horses are not beasts at all; verily he makes the oxen and the horses look with him. So many are the animals [4], bipeds and quadrupeds; them indeed he puts down in the fire, in that he puts down the heads of the animals. &lsquo;I appoint for thee N.N. of the forest&rsquo;, he says; verily from the cattle of the village he sends pain to those of the wild; therefore of animals born at one time the animals of the wild are the smaller, for they are afflicted with pain. He puts down the head of a snake; verily he wins the brilliance that is in the snake [5]. If he were to put it down looking with the heads of the animals, (the snakes) would bite the animals of the village; if turned away, those of the wild; he should speak a Yajus, he wins the brilliance that is in the snake, he injures not the animals of the village, nor those of the wild. Or rather should it be put down; in that he puts down, thereby he wins the brilliance that is in the serpent; in that he utters a Yajus, thereby is it appeased.<br>
The First Layer of Bricks</p>
<h4 id="10-25">10</h4>
<p>The fire is an animal, now the birthplace of the animal is changed in that before the putting up of the bricks the Yajus is performed. The water bricks are seed; be puts down the water bricks; verily he places seed in the womb. Five he puts down (on the east) cattle are fivefold; verily he produces cattle for him; five on the south, the water bricks are the thunderbolt; verily with the thunderbolt he smites away the Raksases from the south of the sacrifice; five he puts down on the west [1], pointing east; seed is impregnated in front from behind; verily from behind he deposits seed for him in front. Five he puts down on the east, pointing west; five on the west pointing east; therefore seed is impregnated in front, offspring are born at the back. On the north he puts down five metre bricks; the metre bricks are cattle; verily he brings cattle on birth to his own dwelling. This (earth) was afraid of excessive burning by the fire; she saw these [2] water bricks, she put them down, then (the fire) did not burn her excessively; in that he puts down the water bricks, (it is) to avoid excessive burning. She said, &lsquo;He shall eat food with holy power, for whom these shall be put down, and he who shall know them thus.&rsquo; He puts down the breath-supporting (bricks); verily he places the breaths in the seed; therefore an animal is born with speech, breath, sight, and bearing. &lsquo;This one in front [3], the existent&rsquo;; (with these words) he puts down on the east; verily with these he supports breath. &lsquo;This one on the right, the all-worker&rsquo;, (with these words he puts down) on the south; verily with these he supports mind. &lsquo;This one behind, the all-extending&rsquo;, (with these words he puts down) on the west; verily with these he supports sight. &lsquo;This one on the left, the light&rsquo;, (with these words he puts down) on the north; verily with these he supports hearing. &lsquo;This one above, thought&rsquo;, (with these words he puts down) above; verily with these he supports speech. Ten by ten he puts (them) down, to give strength. Transversely [4] he puts (them) down; therefore transversely do animals move their limbs, for support. With those (put down) on the east Vasistha prospered, with those on the south Bharadvaja, with those on the west Viśvamitra, with those on the north Jamadagni, with those above Viśvakarman. He who knows thus the prosperity in these (bricks) prospers; he who knows thus their relationship becomes rich in relations; he who knows thus their ordering, (things) go orderly [5] for him; he who knows thus their abode becomes possessed of an abode; he who knows thus their support becomes possessed of support. Having put down the breath-supporters he puts down the unifying (bricks); verily having deposited in him the breaths he unifies them with the</p>
<p>unifying (bricks); that is why the unifying have their name. Then too he puts inspiration upon expiration; therefore expiration and inspiration move together. He puts (them) down pointing in different directions; therefore expiration and inspiration go in different directions. The ununified part of the fire [6] is not worthy of heaven; the fire is worthy of heaven; in that he puts down the unifying (bricks), he unifies it; verily he makes it worthy of heaven. &lsquo;The eighteen-month-old calf the strength, the Krta of throws at dice&rsquo;, he says; verily by the strengths he wins the throws, and by the throws the strengths. On all sides (these verses) have the word wind&rsquo;, and therefore the (wind) blows on all sides.<br>

<p>Now this fire (ritual) is an extensive sacrifice; what part of it is performed or what not? The part of the sacrifice which is performed that is omitted becomes rotten; be puts down the Aśvin (bricks); the Aśvins are the physicians of the gods; verily by them be produces medicine for it. Five he puts down; the sacrifice is fivefold; verily he produces medicine for the whole extent of the sacrifice. He puts down the seasonal (bricks), to arrange the seasons [1]. Five he puts down; the seasons are five; verily he arranges the seasons in their whole number. They begin and end alike; therefore the seasons are alike; they differ in one foot; therefore the seasons differ likewise. He puts down the breath-supporters; verily he places the breaths in the months; therefore being alike the seasons do not grow old; moreover he generates them. The breath is the wind; in that having put down the seasonal (bricks) he puts down the breath-sup porters [2], therefore the wind accompanies all the seasons. He puts down the rain-winners; verily he wins rain. If he were to put them down in one place, then would fall rain in one season only; he puts them down after carrying them round in order; therefore it rains in all the seasons. Since having put down the breath-supporters he puts down the rain-winners, therefore the rain starts from the sky, impelled downwards by the wind. The strengthening (bricks) are cattle; cattle have various purposes and various customs, but only as regards water are they of one purpose [3]; if he desire of a man, &lsquo;May he be without cattle&rsquo;, he should put down for him the strengthening (bricks) and then put down the water (bricks); verily he makes discord for him with cattle; verily he becomes without cattle. If he desire of a man, &lsquo;May he possess cattle&rsquo;, he should put down for him the water (bricks) and then put down the strengthening (bricks); verily he makes concord for him with cattle and he becomes possessed of cattle. He puts down four in front; therefore the eye has four forms, two white, two black [4]. The (verses) contain the word &lsquo;head&rsquo;; therefore the head (of the fire) is in front. Five he puts down in the right hip, five in the left; therefore the animal is broader behind and receding in front; &lsquo;The goat in strength&rsquo;, (with these words he puts down) on the right shoulder; (with) &lsquo;The ram in strength&rsquo;, on the left; verily he puts together the shoulders (of the fire). &lsquo;The tiger in strength&rsquo;, (with these words) he puts down in the right wing, (with) &lsquo;The lion in strength&rsquo; on the left; verily he gives strength to the wings. (With) &lsquo;The man in strength&rsquo; (he puts down) in the middle; therefore man is overlord of animals.</p>
<h4 id="02-26">02</h4>
<p>&lsquo;O Indra and Agni, (the brick) that quaketh not&rsquo;, (with these words) he puts down the naturally perforated (brick); these worlds are separated by Indra and Agni; (verily it serves) to separate these worlds. Now the middle layer is, as it were, insecure, it is as it were the atmosphere; &lsquo;Indra and Agni&rsquo;, he says; Indra and Agni are the supporters of force among the gods; verily he piles it with force in the atmosphere, for support. He puts down the naturally perforated (brick); the naturally perforated (brick) is the atmosphere; verily he puts down the atmosphere [1]. He makes the horse sniff it; verily he puts breath in it; now the horse is connected with Prajapati; verily by Prajapati he piles the fire. It is a naturally perforated (brick), to allow the passage of the breaths, and also for the lighting up of the world of heaven. When the gods went to the world of heaven, the quarters were in confusion; they saw these regional (bricks), they put them down, and by them they made firm the</p>
<p>quarters; in that he put down the regional bricks, (it is) to support the quarters. Ten breath supporters he places in the east [2]; the breaths in man are nine, the navel is the tenth; verily he places the breaths in front; therefore the breaths are in front. He puts down the last with the word &lsquo;light&rsquo;; there fore speech, which is the last, is the light of the breaths. He put down ten; the Viraj has ten syllables, the light of the metres is the Viraj; verily he puts the light in the east; therefore we revere the light in the east. The metres ran a race for the cattle; the Brhati won them; there fore cattle are called connected with the Brhati [3]. &lsquo;Ma metre&rsquo;, (with these words) he puts down on the south; therefore the months turn south wards; (with) &lsquo;Earth metre&rsquo; (he puts down) on the west, for support; (with) &lsquo;Agni, the deity&rsquo; (he puts down) on the north; Agni is might; verily on the north he places might; therefore he that advances to the north is victorious. They make up thirty-six; the Brhati has thirty-six syllables, cattle are connected with the Brhati; verily by the Brhati he wins cattle for him. The Brhati holds the sovereignty of the metres; he for whom these [4] are put down attains sovereignty. He puts down seven Valakhilya, (bricks) in the east, seven in the west; in the head there are seven breaths, two below; (verily they serve) to give the breaths strength. &lsquo;The head thou art, ruling&rsquo;, (with these words) he puts down on the east; &lsquo;Thou art the prop ruling&rsquo;, (with these words) he puts down on the west; verily he makes the breaths accordant for him.</p>

<p>Whatever the gods did at the sacrifice the Asuras did. The gods saw these Aksnayastomiya (bricks), they put them down on one place after reciting in another; the Asuras could not follow it; then the gods prospered, the Asuras were defeated. In that he puts down the Aksnayastomiyas in one place after reciting in another, (it is) to overcome foes: he prospers himself, his foe is defeated. &lsquo;The swift, the triple&rsquo;, (with these words) he puts down on the east; the triple is the beginning of the sacrifice [1]; verily in the east he establishes the beginning of the sacrifice. &lsquo;The sky, the seventeenfold &lsquo;, (with these words be puts down) on the south; the sky is food, the seventeenfold is food; verily on the south he places food; therefore with the right (hand) is food eaten. &lsquo;Support, the twenty-onefold&rsquo;, (with these words he puts down) on the west; the twenty-onefold is support; (verily it serves) for support. &lsquo;The shining, the fifteenfold&rsquo;, (with these words he puts down) on the north; the shining is force; verily he places force on the north; therefore he that advances to the north is victorious. &lsquo;Speed, the eighteenfold&rsquo;, (with these words) he puts down on the east [2]; two threefold ones he establishes in the beginning of the sacrifice in order. &lsquo;Attack, the twentyfold&rsquo;, (with these words he puts down) on the south; Attack is food, the twentyfold is food; verily he places food on the south therefore with the right is food eaten. &lsquo;Radiance, the twenty-twofold&rsquo;, (with these words he puts down) on the west; in that there are twenty, thereby there are two Viraj verses; in that there are two there is support; verily in order he finds support in the Viraj verses and in the eating of food. &lsquo;Fervour, the nineteenfold&rsquo;, (with these words he puts down) on the north; therefore the left hand [3] has the greater fervour. &lsquo;The womb, the twenty-fourfold&rsquo;, (with these words) he puts down on the east; the Gayatri has twenty-four syllables, the beginning of the sacrifice is the Gayatri; verily on the east he establishes the beginning of the sacrifice. &lsquo;The embryo, the twenty-fivefold&rsquo;, (with these words he puts down) on the south; embryos are food, the twenty-fivefold is food; verily he places food on the south; therefore with the right is food eaten. &lsquo;Force the twenty sevenfold&rsquo;, (with these words he puts down) on the west; the twenty-seven fold is these worlds; verily he finds support in these worlds. &lsquo;Maintenance, the twenty-fourfold&rsquo;, (with these words he puts down) on the north [4]; therefore the left hand is most to be maintained. &lsquo;Inspiration, the thirty-onefold&rsquo;, (with these words) he puts down on the east; inspiration is speech, speech is the beginning of the sacrifice; verily he establishes the beginning of the sacrifice on the east. &lsquo;The surface of the tawny one, the thirty fourfold&rsquo;, (with these words he puts down) on the south; the surface of the tawny one is yonder sun; verily he places splendour on the south; therefore the right side is the more resplendent. &lsquo;Support, the thirty threefold&rsquo;, (with these words he puts down) on the west, for support. &lsquo;The vault, the thirty sixfold&rsquo;, (with these words he puts down) on the north&rsquo;; the vault is the world of heaven; (verily it serves) to attain the world of heaven.</p>

Ten by ten he puts (them) down, to confer power on them. Transversely he puts (them) down; therefore cattle move their limbs transversely, for support. By those metres which were heavenly, the gods went to the world of heaven; for that the seers toiled [3]; they practised fervour, these they saw by fervour, and from them they fashioned these bricks. &lsquo;The course metre; the space metre&rsquo;, (with these words) they put them down; with these they went to the world of heaven; in that he puts down these bricks, the sacrifice goes to the world of heaven with the metres that are heavenly.

Now these offspring, though having expiration and inspiration, hearing and seeing, did not couple; upon them he bestowed copulation (with the words) &lsquo;Thou art the Trivrt&rsquo;. These offspring though coupling [2] were not propagated; he made them propagate (with the words) &lsquo;Thou art the mounter, thou art the descender&rsquo;. These offspring being propagated did not find support; he made them find support in these worlds (with the words) &lsquo;Thou art the wealthy, thou art the brilliant, thou art the gainer of good&rsquo;, verily he makes offspring when propagated find support in these worlds, he with his body mounts the atmosphere, with his expiration he finds support in yonder world, of expiration and inspiration he is not liable to be deprived who knows thus.</p>

<p>By the &lsquo;sitters on the vault&rsquo; the gods went to the world of heaven; that is why the &lsquo;sitters on the vault&rsquo; have their name. In that he puts down the &lsquo;sitters on the vault&rsquo;, the sacrificer thus goes by the &lsquo;sitters on the vault&rsquo; to the world of heaven; the vault is the world of heaven; for him for whom these are put down there is no misfortune (ná-ákam); the &lsquo;sitters on the vault&rsquo; are the home of the sacrificer; in that he puts down the &lsquo;sitters on the vault&rsquo;, the sacrificer thus makes himself a home. The &lsquo;sitters on the vault&rsquo; are the collected brilliance of the Prstha (Stotras); in that he puts down the &lsquo;sitters on the vault&rsquo; [1], verily he wins the brilliance of the Prsthas. He puts down the five crested; verily becoming Apsarases they wait on him in yonder world; verily also they are the bodyguards of the sacrificer. He should think of whomever he hates as he puts (them) down; verily he cuts him off for these deities; swiftly he goes to ruin. He puts (them) above the &lsquo;sitters on the vault&rsquo;; that is as when having taken a wife one seats her in the house [2]; he puts the highest on the west, pointing east; therefore the wife attends on the west, facing east. He puts as the highest the naturally perforated and the earless (bricks); the naturally perforated is breath, the earless is life; verily he places breath and life as the highest of the breaths; therefore are breath and life the highest of the breaths. No brick higher (than these) should he put down; if he were to put another brick higher, he would obstruct the breath and life of cattle [3] and of the sacrificer; there fore no other brick should be put down higher. He puts down the naturally perforated brick; the naturally perforated brick is yonder</p>

The Horse Sacrifice (continued)</p>
<h4 id="12-16">12</h4>
<p>The eye of Prajapati swelled, that fell away, that became a horse; because it swelled (áśvayat), that is the reason why the horse (áśva) has its name. By the horse sacrifice the gods replaced it. He who sacrifices with the horse sacrifice makes Prajapati whole; verily he becomes whole; this is the atonement for everything, and the cure for everything. All evil by it the gods overcame; by it also the gods overcame (the sins of) Brahman- slaying; all evil [1] he overcomes, he overcomes Brahman-slaying who sacrifices with the horse sacrifice, and he who knows it thus. It was the left eye of Prajapati that swelled; therefore they cut off from the horse on the left side, on the right from other animals. The mat is of reeds; the horse has its birthplace in the waters, the reed is born in the waters; verily he establishes it in its own birthplace. The Stoma is the fourfold one; the bee tore the thigh of the horse, the gods made it whole with the fourfold Stoma; in that there is the fourfold Stoma, (it is) to make whole the horse.</p>

<p>The gods and the Asuras were in conflict, they could not decide the issue; Indra saw these bodies, he put them down; with them he conferred upon himself power, strength, and body; then the gods prospered, the Asuras were defeated. In that he puts down Indra&rsquo;s bodies, the sacrificer with them bestows on himself power, strength, and body; verily also he piles up the fire with Indra and with a<br>
body; be prospers himself, his foe is [1] defeated. The sacrifice departed from the gods; they could not recover it; they saw these bodies of the sacrifice, they put them down, and by them they recovered the sacrifice. In that he puts down the bodies of the sacrifice, the sacrificer by them wins the sacrifice. Three and thirty he puts down; the gods are three and thirty; verily he wins the gods; verily also he piles up the fire with itself and with a body; he becomes with his body in yonder world [2], who knows thus.

<h4 id="02-27">02</h4>
<p>He puts down the seasonal (bricks), to arrange the seasons. He puts down a pair; therefore the seasons are in pairs. This middle layer is as it were unsupported; it is as it were the atmosphere; he puts down a pair on the other layers, but four in the middle one, for support. The seasonal (bricks) are the internal cement of the layers; in that he puts down the seasonal (bricks), (it is) to keep apart the layers. He puts down next an Avaka plant; this is the birthplace of Agni; verily he piles up the fire with its birthplace [1]. Viśvamitra says, &lsquo;He shall eat food with holy power, for whom these shall be put down, and he who shall know them thus&rsquo;. It is the year which repels from support him who having piled up the fire does not find support; there are five layers preceding, and then he piles up the sixth; the year has six seasons; verily in the seasons the year finds support. These are the bricks [2], called the over-ladies; he for whom they are put down becomes the overlord of his equals; he should think of him whom he hates as he puts (them down); verily he cuts him off for those deities; swiftly he goes to ruin. The Angirases, going to the world of heaven, made over to the seers the accomplishment of the sacrifice; it became gold; in that he anoints with fragments of gold, (it is) for the completion of the sacrifice; verily also he makes healing for it [3]; moreover he unites it with its form, and with golden light he goes to the world of heaven.

<p>The fire is Rudra; he is born then when he is completely piled up; just as a calf on birth desires the teat, so he here seeks his portion; if he were not to offer a libation to him, he would suck the Adhvaryu and the sacrificer. He offers the Çatarudriya (oblation); verily he appeases him with his own portion; neither Adhvaryu nor sacrificer goes to ruin. If he were to offer with the milk of domesticated animals [1], he would afflict domestic animals with pain; if (with that) of wild (animals), wild (animals); he should offer with groats of wild sesame or with groats of Gavidhuka grass; he harms neither domesticated nor wild animals. Then they say, &lsquo;Wild sesame and Gavidhuka grass are not a proper offering&rsquo;; he offers with goat&rsquo;s milk, the female goat is connected with Agni; verily he offers with a proper offering; he harms neither domesticated nor wild animals. The Angirases going to the world of heaven [2] spilled the cauldron on the goat; she in pain dropped a feather (like hair), it became the Arka (plant); that is why the Arka has its name. He offers with a leaf of the Arka, to unite it with its birthplace. He offers standing facing north; this is the quarter of Rudra; verily he propitiates him in his own quarter. He offers on the last brick; verily at the end he propitiates Rudra. He offers dividing it into three; these worlds are three; verily he makes these worlds of even strength; at this height he offers [3], then at this, then at this; these worlds are three; verily he appeases him for these worlds. Three further libations he offers; they make up six, the seasons are six; verily with the seasons he appeases him. If he were to offer while wandering round, he would make Rudra come within (the sacrifice). Or rather they say, &lsquo;In what quarter is Rudra or in what?&rsquo; He should offer them while wandering round; verily he appeases him completely [4]. The highest (bricks) are the heavenly deities; over them he makes the sacrificer speak; verily by them he makes him attain the world of heaven; he should throw (the leaf) down in the path of the cattle of him whom he hates; the first beast that steps upon it goes to ruin.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The strength on the stone&rsquo;, (with these words) he moistens (the fire), and so purifies it; verily also he delights it; it delighted attends him, causing him neither hunger nor pain in yonder world; he rejoices in offspring, in cattle who knows thus. &lsquo;That food and strength, do ye, O Maruts, bounteously bestow on us&rsquo;, he says; strength is food, the Maruts are food; verily he wins food. &lsquo;In the stone is thy hunger; let thy pain reach N.N.

Thrice again he goes round; they make up six, the seasons are six; verily with the seasons he calms its pain. The reed is the flower of the waters, the Avaka is the cream of the waters [2]; he draws over (it) with a branch of reeds and with Avaka plants; the waters are appeased; verily with them appeased he calms his pain. The beast that first steps over the fire when piled, it is liable to burn it up with its heat. He draws over (it) with a frog; this of animals is the one on which one does not subsist, for neither among the domesticated nor the wild beasts has it a place; verily he afflicts it with pain. With eight (verses) he draws across [3]; the Gayatri has eight syllables, the fire is connected with the Gayatri; verily he calms the pain of the whole extent of the fire. (He draws) with (verses) containing (the word) &lsquo;purifying&rsquo;, the purifying (one) is food; verily by food he calms its pain. The fire is death; the black antelope skin is the form of holy power; he puts on a pair of black sandals; verily by the holy power he shuts himself away from death. &lsquo;He shuts himself away from death, and away from eating food&rsquo;, they say; one he puts on, the other not; verily he shuts himself away [4] from death and wins the eating of food. &lsquo;Honour to thy heat, thy blaze&rsquo;, he says, for paying honour they wait on a richer man; &lsquo;may thy bolts afflict another than us&rsquo;, he says; verily him whom he hates he afflicts with its pain; &lsquo;be thou purifying and auspicious to us&rsquo;, he says; the purifying (one) is food; verily he wins food. With two (verses) he strides over (it), for support; (with two) containing (the word) &lsquo;water&rsquo;, for soothing.</p>

<p>&lsquo;To him that sits in man hail!&rsquo; (with these words) he pours butter on; verily with the Pankti and the offering he takes hold of the beginning of the sacrifice. He pours on butter transversely; therefore animals move their limbs transversely, for support. If he were to utter the Vasat cry, his Vasat cry<br>
would be exhausted; if he were not to utter the Vasat cry, the Raksases would destroy the sacrifice; Vat he says; verily, mysteriously he utters the Vasat cry; his Vasat, cry is not exhausted, the Raksases do not destroy the sacrifice. Some of the gods eat the offerings [1], others do not; verily he delights both sets by piling up the fire. &lsquo;Those gods among gods&rsquo;, (with these words) he anoints (it) with curds mixed with honey; verily the sacrificer delights the gods who eat and those who do not eat the offerings; they delight the sacrificer. He delights those who eat the offerings with curds, and those who do not with honey; curds is a food of the village, honey of the wild; in that he anoints with curds mixed with honey, (it serves) to win both. He anoints with a large handful (of grass); the large handful is connected with Prajapati [2]; (verily it serves) to unite it with its birthplace; with two (verses) he anoints, for support. He anoints going round in order; verily he delights them completely.

Indra slew Vrtra; him Vrtra [3] slain grasped with sixteen coils; he saw this libation to Agni of the front; he offered it, and Agni of the front, being delighted with his own portion, burnt in sixteen places the coils of Vrtra; by the offspring to Viśvakarman he was set free from evil; in that he offers a libation to Agni of the front, Agni of the front, delighted with his own portion, burns away his evil, and he is set free from his evil by the offering to Viśvakarman. If he desire of a man, &lsquo;May he be set free slowly from evil&rsquo; [4], he should offer one by one for him; verily, slowly he is set free from evil; if he desire of a man, &lsquo;Swiftly may he be set free from evil&rsquo;, he should run over all of them for him and make one offering; swiftly is he set free from evil. Or rather he sacrifices separately with each hymn; verily severally he places strength in the two hymns; (verily they serve) for support.</p>

The gods and the Asuras were in conflict; the gods saw the unassailable (hymn) and with it they conquered the Asuras [3]; that is why the unassailable (hymn) has its name. In that the second Hotr recites the unassailable (hymn) the sacrificer conquers his foes therewith unassailably; verily also he conquers what has not been conquered. (The hymn) has ten verses; the Viraj has ten syllables, by the Viraj are kept apart these two worlds; (verily it serves) to keep apart these two worlds. Again the Viraj has ten syllables, the Viraj is food; verily he finds support in the Viraj, in eating food.

If he were to yoke with all five together, his fire yoked would fall away, the libations would be without support, the Stomas without support, the hymns without support. He strokes (the fire) with three (verses) at the morning pressing; the fire is threefold [1]; verily he yokes the full extent of the fire; that is as when something is placed on a yoked cart; the oblations find support, the Stomas find support, the hymns find support. He strokes with two (verses) in the Stotra of the Yajñayajñiya; the sacrifice is as great as is the Agnistoma; a further extension is performed over and above it; verily he mounts at the end the whole extent of the sacrifice. (He strokes) with two (verses), for support; when it is not completed by one (verse), then [2] does he stroke; the rest of the sacrifice resorts to him; (verily it serves) for continuity. He who piles up the fire falls away from this world; his libation cannot be performed in a place without bricks; whatever libation he offers in a place without bricks, it runs away, and with its running away the sacrifice is ruined, with the sacrifice the sacrificer; in that he piles up a second piling, (it is) to support the libations; the libations find support [3], the sacrifice is not ruined, nor the sacrificer. He puts down eight; the Gayatri has eight syllables; verily he piles it with the Gayatri metre; if eleven, with the Tristubh, if twelve with the Jagati verily he piles it with the metres. The fire that is re-piled is called the descendant; he who knowing thus re-piles the fire eats food up to the third generation. The re-piling is like the re-establishment of the fire; he who does not succeed through the establishment of the fire [4] re-establishes it; he who does not succeed by the piling up of the fire re-piles it. In that he piles up the fire, (it is) for prosperity. Or rather they say, &lsquo;one should not pile it up.&rsquo; The fire is Rudra, and it is as if one stirs up a sleeping lion. But again they say, &lsquo;One should pile it up.&rsquo; It is as if one awakens a richer man with his due portion. Manu piled the fire; with it he did not prosper; he saw this re-piling, he piled it, with it he prospered; in that he piles the re-piling, (it is) for prosperity.</p>

<p>He who desires cattle should pile a piling with the metres; the metres are cattle; verily he becomes rich in cattle. He should pile in hawk shape who desires the sky; the hawk is the best flier among birds; verily becoming a hawk he flies to the world of heaven. He should pile in heron form who desires, &lsquo;May I be possessed of a head in yonder world&rsquo;; verily he becomes possessed of a head in yonder world. He should pile in the form of an Alaja bird, with four furrows, who desires support; there are four quarters; verily he finds support in the quarters. He should pile in the form of a triangle, who has foes [1]; verily he repels his foes. He should pile in triangle form on both sides, who desires, &lsquo;May I repel the foes I have and those I shall have&rsquo;; verily he repels the foes he has and those he will have. He should pile in the form of a chariot wheel, who has foes; the chariot is a thunderbolt; verily he hurls the thunderbolt at his foes. He should pile in the form of a wooden</p>
<p>trough who desires food; in a wooden trough food is kept; verily he wins food together with its place of birth. He should pile one that has to be collected together, who desires cattle; verily he becomes rich in cattle [2]. He should pile one in a circle, who desires a village; verily he becomes possessed of a village. He should pile in the form of a cemetery, who desires, &lsquo;May I be successful in the world of the fathers&rsquo;; verily he is successful in the world of the fathers. Viśvamitra and Jamadagni had a feud with Vasistha; Jamadagni saw these Vihavya (bricks); he put them down, and with them he appropriated the power and strength of Vasistha; in that he puts down the Vihavyas, the sacrificer with them appropriates the power and strength of his foe. He puts down on the altar of the Hotr; the Hotr is the abode of the sacrificer [3]; verily in his abode he wins for him power and strength. Twelve he puts down; the Jagati has twelve syllables, cattle are connected with the Jagati; verily with the Jagati he wins cattle for him. Eight each he puts down in the other altars; cattle have eight half-hooves; verily he wins cattle. (He puts down) six on the Marjaliya; the seasons are six, the gods, the fathers, are the seasons; verily he delights the seasons, the gods, the fathers.<br>
The Horse Sacrifice (continued)</p>
<h4 id="12-17">12</h4>
<p>&lsquo;Be &lsquo;pure for the winning of strength&rsquo;, this is the Anustubh strophe; three Anustubhs make four Gayatris; in that there are three Anustubhs, therefore the horse when standing stands on three feet; in that there are four Gayatri is, therefore he goes putting down all four feet. The Anustubh is the highest of metres, the fourfold Stoma is the highest of Stomas, the three-night sacrifice the highest of sacrifices, the horse the highest of animals; verily by the highest he makes him go to the highest state. It is the twenty-onefold day [1], on which the horse is slain, there are twelve months, five seasons; these worlds are three; the twenty-onefold (Stoma) is yonder sun; this is Prajapati, the horse is connected with Prajapati; verily he wins it straightway. The Prstha (Stotra) is of Çakvari verses to make the horse complete, there are various metres, different sets of animals are offered, both domesticated and wild; in that the Prstha is of Çakvari verses, (it is) to complete the horse. The Saman of the Brahman is that of Prthuraśmi; by the rein the horse is restrained [2], a horse unrestrained and unsupported is liable to go to the furthest distance; (verily it serves) to restrain and support the horse. The Achavaka&rsquo;s Saman is the Samkrti; the horse sacrifice is an extensive sacrifice; &lsquo;who knows&rsquo;, they say, &lsquo;if all of it is done or not?&rsquo; In that the Achavaka&rsquo;s Saman is the Samkrti, (it serves) to make the horse whole, to win it entirely, to prevent interference. The last day is an Atiratra with all the Stomas, to obtain all, to conquer all; verily he obtains all, he conquers all with it.</p>

<p>In that he completes (the sacrifice) with one animal, (it is) for the continuity of the sacrifice and to avoid cutting it in two. The male animals belong to Indra; in that being Indra&rsquo;s they are offered to the fires, he causes strife among the deities. He should use Tristubh verses, appertaining to Agni, for the Yajyas and Anuvakyas; in that they appertain to Agni, (the verses) are Agni&rsquo;s, in that they are Tristubhs (they are) Indra&rsquo;s; (verily they serve) for prosperity; he does not cause strife among the deities. To Vayu of the team he offers a hornless (animal); Vayu is the brilliance of Agni; it is offered to brilliance; therefore wheresoever the wind [1] blows, the fire burns; verily it follows its own brilliance. If he were not to offer to him of the team, the sacrificer would go mad; (an offering) is made to him of the team, to prevent the sacrificer going mad. The Yajya and the Anuvakya, contain (the words) &lsquo;wind&rsquo; and &lsquo;white&rsquo;, to secure brilliance. &lsquo;The golden germ first arose&rsquo;, (with these words) he pours out the butter portion; the golden germ is Prajapati; (verily it serves) for likeness to Prajapati. This (animal) is slain to make up all forms of animals; its hairs are [2] the form of man, its lack of horns that of horses, the possession of one set of incisors only that of cows, the sheep-like</p>
<p>hooves that of sheep, that it is a goat, that is the form of goats. The wind is the abode dear to cattle; in that it is offered to Vayu, in accord cattle wait upon him. &lsquo;Should an animal be offered to Vayu, or to Prajapati?&rsquo; they say; if he were to offer it to Vayu, he would depart from Prajapati; if he were<br>
to offer it to Prajapati, he would depart from Vayu [3]; in that the animal is offered to Vayu, therefore he does not depart; in that a cake is offered to Prajapati, therefore he does not depart from Prajapati; in that it is offered on twelve potsherds, therefore he does not depart from Vaiśvanara. When about to consecrate himself, he offers to Agni and Visnu on eleven potsherds; all the deities are Agni; the sacrifice is Visnu; verily he lays hold of the deities and the sacrifice; Agni is the lowest of the deities, Visnu the highest; in that he offers to Agni and Visnu on eleven potsherds, the sacrificer envelops the gods [4] on both sides and wins them. By the cake the gods prospered in yonder world, by the oblation in this; he who desires, &lsquo;May I prosper in yonder world&rsquo;, should offer a cake; verily he prospers in yonder world. In that it is offered on eight pot sherds, it is connected with Agni, in that it is offered on three potsherds, it is connected with Visnu; (verily it serves) for prosperity. He who desires, &lsquo;May I prosper in the world&rsquo;, should offer an oblation; the ghee belongs to Agni, the rice grains to Visnu, therefore [5] an oblation should be offered; verily he prospers in this world. It is (an offering) to Aditi; Aditi is this (earth); verily he finds support in this (earth); verily also be extends the sacrifice over this. He who piles the fire without keeping it in the pan for a year-(it is with him) as when an embryo is dropped prematurely would go to ruin; he should offer before (the others) on twelve potsherds to Vaiśvanara; Agni Vaiśvanara is the year; even as (an embryo) attaining a year&rsquo;s growth [61 is born when the due season&rsquo; is come, so he having obtained the year when the due season is come, piles the fire; he goes not to ruin. Vaiśvanara is the form dear to Agni; verily he wins the form dear to him. These offerings are three; these worlds are three; (verily they serve) for the mounting of these worlds.</p>

<p>Prajapati after creating creatures in affection entered into them; from them he could not emerge; he said, &lsquo;He shall prosper who shall pile me again hence.&rsquo; The gods piled him; then they prospered; in that they piled him, that is why the piling has its name. He who knowing thus piles the fire is prosperous. &lsquo;For what good is the fire piled?&rsquo; they say. &lsquo;May I be possessed of the fire&rsquo; [1], (with this aim) is the fire piled; verily be becomes possessed of the fire. &lsquo;For what good is the fire piled?&rsquo; they say. &lsquo;May the gods know me&rsquo;, (with this hope) is the fire piled; the gods know him. &lsquo;For what good is the fire piled?&rsquo; they say. &lsquo;May I have a house&rsquo;, (with this hope) is the fire piled; verily he becomes possessed of a house. &lsquo;For what good is the fire piled?&rsquo; they say. &lsquo;May I be rich in cattle&rsquo;, (with this hope) is the fire [2] piled; verily he becomes rich in cattle. &lsquo;For what good is the fire piled?&rsquo; they say. &lsquo;May the seven men live upon me&rsquo;, (with this hope) is the fire piled; three before, three behind, the self the seventh; so many live upon him in yonder world. Prajapati desired to pile the fire; to him spake earth; &lsquo;Thou shalt not pile the fire on me; thou wilt burn me excessively, and I being burned excessively will shake you apart [3]; thou wilt fall into a sorry state.&rsquo; He replied, &lsquo;So shall I act that it will not burn thee excessively.&rsquo; He stroked it, (saying), &lsquo;May Prajapati seat thee; with that deity, in the manner of Angiras, do thou sit firm&rsquo;; verily making this a brick he put it down, to prevent excessive burning. That on which he is to pile the fire he should stroke, (saying), &lsquo;May Prajapati seat thee; with that deity in the manner of Angiras, do thou sit firm&rsquo; [4]; verily making this a brick he sets it down to prevent excessive burning. Prajapati desired, &lsquo;Let me be propagated&rsquo;, he saw this (fire) in the pan, he bore it for a year, then was he propagated. Therefore for a year must it be borne, then is he propagated. To him the Vasus said, &lsquo;Thou hast been propagated; let us be propagated.&rsquo; He gave it to the Vasus, they bore it for three days, thereby [5] they created three hundred, three and thirty; therefore should it be borne for three days; verily is he propagated. To them the Rudras said, &lsquo;Ye have been propagated, let us be propagated.&rsquo; They gave it to the Rudras; they bore it for six days, thereby they created three hundred, three and thirty; therefore should it be borne for six days; verily is he propagated. To them the Adityas said, &lsquo;Ye have been propagated; let us [6] be propagated&rsquo;. They gave it to the Adityas, they bore it for twelve days, thereby they created three hundred, three and thirty; therefore should it be borne for twelve days; verily is he propagated. Thereby they created a thousand, the pan being the thousandth; he who knows thus the pan as the thousandth obtains a thousand cattle.</p>

<p>&lsquo;With a Yajus it is made, with a Yajus it is cooked, with a Yajus it is set loose, this pan; it is therefore exhausted, it cannot be used again&rsquo;, they say. &lsquo;O Agni, yoke thy (steeds)&rsquo;, &lsquo;Yoke them that best invoke the gods&rsquo;, (with these words) he offers in the pan; verily he yokes it again and thereby is it not exhausted. He, who yokes Agni where the yoking is to be performed, yokes him (best) among those who are yoking. &lsquo;O Agni [1], yoke thy (steeds)&rsquo;, &lsquo;Yoke them that best invoke the gods&rsquo;, he says;&rsquo; this is the yoking of Agni; verily he yokes him, and yokes him (best) among those who are yoking. The theologians say, &lsquo;Should the fire be piled up with face down, or face upwards?&rsquo; Now the fire is piled in the likeness of birds; if he were to pile it face downward, the libations would reach it behind; if upwards, it could not fly, it would not be heavenly for him; he puts down the human head towards the east, face upwards [2]; verily the libations reach it in the mouth; he does not pile it face upwards; verily it is heavenly for him. He offers with (a verse) addressed to Surya; verily he bestows sight upon it; twice he offers, for there are two eyes; he offers with the same verse, for sight is the same, for prosperity. The gods and the Asuras were in conflict, they deposited their desirable wealth; the gods appropriated it by means of the Vamabhrt (brick); that is why the Vamabhrt (supporting the desirable) has its name. In that he puts down the Vamabhrt, the sacrificer by it appropriates the desirable wealth of his foe. It has a head of gold; gold is light, the desirable is light; verily by light he appropriates the desirable which is light; there are two Yajuses, for support.</p>
<h4 id="04-30">04</h4>
<p>The waters were the wives of Varuna; Agni longed for them, he had union with them; his seed fell away, it became this (earth); what second fell away became yonder (sky); this is the Viraj, yonder the Svaraj; in that he puts down two Viraj (bricks) he puts down these two (worlds). Now the seed<br>
which yonder (sky) impregnates, finds support in this (earth), it is propagated, it becomes plants [1] and shoots; them the fire eats. He who knows thus is propagated, and becomes an eater of food. If a man be full of seed, one should put both down in the first layer for him; verily these in accord pour<br>
seed for him; if a man have poured his seed, he should put one in the first layer for him and one in the last; verily he encloses by the two (worlds) the seed he has impregnated. For a year to no man [2] should he descend in honour; for these two (worlds) descend in honour for no man; that is their rule. He who piles the fire without a head, becomes headless in yonder world, he who piles it with a head becomes possessed of a head in yonder world. &lsquo;To thought I offer with mind, with ghee, that the gods may come hither, delighting in the offerings, increasing holy order; on the path of the moving ocean I offer all the days to Viśvakarman the undying oblation&rsquo;, (with these words) he puts down the naturally perforated brick and offers [3]; that is the head of the fire; verily he piles the fire with its head. He becomes possessed of a head in yonder world who know thus. The fire is piled for the world of heaven; whatever is done out of order, that is not heavenly; the fire is heavenly; having put down the layer he should stroke it, (saying), &lsquo;May the wise discern wisdom and folly, like backs straight and crooked, like men; for wealth and good offspring, O god, grant us freedom, and keep bondage from us.&rsquo; Verily he puts it down in order. He piles (the fire) facing east; it becomes heavenly for him.</p>

<p>Viśvakarman, lord of the quarters, may he protect our cattle, may he protect us, to him homage! Prajapati; Rudra; Varuna; Agni; lord of the quarters; may he protect our cattle, may he protect us, to him homage!&rsquo;<br>
These are the deities, overlords of these animals; to them he is cut off who puts down the heads of the animals. He puts down the gold bricks; verily he pays honour to these deities. The theologians [1] say, &lsquo;In the fire he places the domesticated animals, with pain he afflicts the wild animals; what<br>
then does he leave?&rsquo; In that he puts down the golden bricks, and gold is immortality, by immortality he makes healing for the domesticated animals, he hurts them not. The first naturally perforated brick is expiration, the second cross -breathing, the third inspiration. Having put down the first naturally perforated brick he should breathe out along it; verily he unites expiration with expiration;</p>
<p>having put down the second [2] he should breathe across; verily he unites cross-breathing with cross-breathing; having put down the third, he should breathe in; verily he unites inspiration with inspiration; verily he kindles him with the breaths. &lsquo;Bhuh, Bhuvah, Suvar&rsquo;, (with these words) he puts down the naturally perforated bricks; the naturally perforated bricks are these worlds; with these exclamations Prajapati was propagated; in that he puts down the naturally perforated bricks with these exclamations, he puts down these worlds, and over these [3] worlds he is propagated. For expiration, for cross-breathing, for inspiration; for speech thee; for sight thee; with that deity, in the manner of Angiras, do thou sit firm. By Agni the gods sought to go to the world of heaven, with him they could not fly; they saw these four naturally perforated bricks, they put them down in the quarters, with him with eyes on all sides they went to the world of heaven. In that he puts down four naturally perforated bricks in the quarters, the sacrificer with Agni with eyes on all sides goes to the world of heaven.</p>

The theologians say, &lsquo;For what reason are other bricks exhausted, the space-filler not?&rsquo; &lsquo;Because it is connected with Indra and Agni and with Brhaspati&rsquo;, he should say, for Indra and Agni and Brhaspati are those among the gods who are not exhausted. It has a follower to avoid monotony. He follows it with an Anustubh; the space filler is the body, the Anustubh the breath; therefore breath comes through all the limbs. &lsquo;They of him, streaming with milk&rsquo; [2], he says; therefore there is sap in every joint; &lsquo;the dappled mix the Soma&rsquo;, he says; the dappled (cow) is food; verily he wins food; Agni is praise, food is praise; verily he wins food; &lsquo;the clans in the birthplace of the gods, in the three realms of sky&rsquo;, he says; verily he makes these worlds full of light for him.

<p>The fire is piled up for the world of heaven; the set of eleven stakes is a thunderbolt; if he were to set up eleven stakes in the fire, he would shut it off from the world of heaven with the thunderbolt; if he were not to set it up, he would sever the animals from the chips; one stake he sets up; verily he does not shut it off from the world of heaven, nor sever the animals from the chips. He who piling the fire steps down on it is deprived of power and strength; he should, with a verse addressed to Indra [1], put down a brick opposite his step; verily he is not deprived of power and strength. The fire is Rudra, his are three missiles, one that comes straight on, one that strikes transversely, and one that follows up. To them he is cut off who piles the fire; having piled the fire he should give (a bow) with three arrows to a Brahman, unasked; verily to them he pays homage, and also he ransoms himself from them.<br>
The bow of thine, O Rudra, in the east [2], may the wind blow after it for thee, to thee, O Rudra, with the year I pay homage.<br>

<p>If one having yoked the fire does not set it free, then just as a horse yoked and not set free in hunger is overcome, so his fire is overcome, and with it being overcome the sacrificer is overcome; he having piled the fire becomes aheat [6]; &lsquo;Suck this mighty breast of the waters&rsquo;, (with these words) he offers a ladle full of butter; this is the freeing of the fire; verily setting it free he gives it food. Therefore they say, both he who knows and he who knows not. &lsquo;A horse well loaded carries well&rsquo;; the horse is Agni; verily he delights him, he delighted delights him; he becomes richer.<br>

<p>He puts down the bricks of being; in every place is death born; wherever death is born, thence he removes it by sacrifice; therefore the piler of the fire lives all his life, for all deaths are removed by him; therefore the piler of the fire is not to be practised against; his witchcraft turns upon him (who does so) and lays him low. He who piles the fire is consecrated; these are the offerings of the divine consecrators; so many are the consecrations of the gods, and they [1] confer consecrations upon him; they consecrate him, the fire is consecration; the royal consecration is the consecration of Varuna; (the fire) to be piled is the consecration of holy power. &lsquo;On the instigation of the god Savitr, thee&rsquo;, he says; verily instigated by Savitr he consecrates him with holy power, with the deities. He pours down every sort of food, to win every sort of food. He pours down over him from the front face to face; for from the front face to face is food eaten. He pours down from the head, for from the head is food eaten; he causes (the water) to flow over up to the mouth [2]; verily on the mouth he bestows food-eating upon him. &lsquo;With the lordship of Agni I consecrate thee&rsquo;, he says; this is the consecration of Agni; verily he consecrates him with it. &lsquo;With the lordship of Brhaspati I consecrate thee&rsquo;, he says; Brhaspati is the holy power of the gods; verily with holy power he consecrates him. &lsquo;With the lordship of Indra I consecrate thee&rsquo;, he says; verily he confers power from above upon him. That [3] is the form of the royal consecration. He who knowing thus piles the fire conquers both the worlds, that of him who has offered the royal consecration and that of the piler of the fire. When Indra had been consecrated, his power and strength fell away in ten places; the gods brought it together with the Sautramani; he who piles the fire is consecrated; having piled the fire he should sacrifice with the Sautramani; verily collecting power and strength he places them in himself.</p>

The year is the year, the Ayavas are the months, the red one the dawn, the steed Surya, the Aśvins these two (worlds), Agni Vaiśvanara the year, the food offerings cattle, ghee cattle. With the year cattle are born; verily with the year he produces cattle for him. He offers on a blade of Darbha grass [1]; the Darbhas are the ambrosia, the strength of the (earth); he offers on it; verily he is propagated. An eater of food he becomes for whom they offer thus. These deities are the foremost portions of Agni; verily he delights them; verily too he places the eye of Agni in front; he becomes not blind who knows thus. Waters were the world at first, the Moving ocean; Prajapati, becoming wind, rocked about on a lotus leaf; he [2] could find no support; he saw that nest of the waters, on it he piled the fire, that became this (earth), then indeed did he find support. (The brick) which he put down in front became the head, that is the eastern quarter; (the brick) which he put down on the right became the right side, that is the southern quarter; (the brick) which he put down behind became the tail, that is the western quarter; (the brick) which he put down on the left [3] became the left side, that is the northern quarter; (the brick) which he put down above became the back, that is the zenith. Agni of the five bricks is this (earth); therefore when they dig in it they knock up against the brick, against gravel. Now all this (earth) in the eyes of the birds shines at night, therefore birds do not at night rest upon it. He who knowing this piles a fire finds support, and conquers all the quarters. The Brahman is connected with Agni, therefore the Brahman finds prosperity in all the quarters; verily every quarter he goes to is his own. The fire is the nest of the waters; therefore waters draw the fire; verily they enter their own birthplace.</p>

<p>Having kept the fire in the pan for a year in the second year he should offer on eight potsherds to Agni, to Indra on eleven potsherds, to the All-gods on twelve potsherds, to Brhaspati an oblation, to Visnu on three potsherds; in the third year he should sacrifice with the Abhijit (offering). In that there is (an offering) on eight potsherds, the Gayatri has eight syllables, and the morning pressing is connected with Agni and the Gayatri, verily he supports by it the morning pressing and the Gayatri metre. In that there is (an offering) on eleven potsherds, the Tristubh has eleven syllables, and the midday pressing is connected with Indra and the Tristubh, verily he supports by it the midday pressing and the Tristubh [1] metre. In that there is (an offering) on twelve potsherds, the Jagati has twelve syllables, and the third pressing is connected with the All-gods and the Jagati, verily he supports by it the third pressing and the Jagati metre.

In that there is (an offering) to Visnu on three potsherds, and Visnu is the sacrifice, verily he supports by it the sacrifice. In that he sacrifices with the Abhijit in the third year, (it serves) for conquest. In that he keeps the fire in the pan for a year, he [2] saves this world by it; in that he piles the fire in the second year, he saves the atmosphere by it; in that he sacrifices in the third year, he saves yonder world by it. This (fire) Para Atnara, Kaksivant Auśija, Vitahavya Çrayasa, and Trasadasyu Paurukutsya piled, being desirous of offspring; then indeed did they win thousands each of children; he is extended with offspring, with cattle, that measure he attains which they attained, who knowing thus piles the fire.</p>

For fifteen nights should he be consecrated; the nights of the half-month are fifteen; the year is made up by the half-months; the Viraj is the year; he obtains the Viraj. For seventeen nights should he be consecrated; the year has twelve months and seven seasons; the Viraj is the year; he obtains the Viraj. For twenty-four nights should he be consecrated; the year has twenty-four half-months; the Viraj is the year; he obtains the Viraj. For thirty nights should he be consecrated [2]; the Viraj has thirty syllables; he obtains the Viraj. For a month should he be consecrated; the year is the month; the Viraj is the year; he obtains the Viraj. For four months should he be consecrated; for four months the Vasus bore him, they conquered the earth, the Gayatri metre; for eight the Rudras, they conquered the atmosphere, the Tristubh metre; for twelve the Adityas, they conquered the sky, the Jagati metre; then they attained distinction, supremacy over the gods. Therefore after keeping the fire for twelve months, should one pile it up; the year has twelve months, the fire to be piled is the year, the bricks are days and nights; he piles him with the bricks obtained; verily also he attains distinction, supremacy over his equals.</p>

In that he piles the fire, he deposits seed; if he were to have intercourse. he would be deprived of seed. Or rather they say, &lsquo;If he were not to have intercourse, there would be no offspring.&rsquo; In that he puts down the two Retahsic (bricks), they support the seed of the sacrificer; therefore he should have intercourse, for the non-spilling of seed.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Three seeds are there, father, son, grandson [4]; if he were to put down two Retahsic (bricks), he would cleave his seed; three he puts down, for the continuity of seed; the first Retahsic is this (earth), this (earth) is speech, therefore they see this (earth), they see speech speaking; the second is the atmosphere, the atmosphere is breath, therefore they see not the atmosphere, nor breath; the third is yonder (sky), yonder (sky) is the eye, therefore they see yonder (sky), they see the eye.

<p>(The fire) in the pan is an embryo, the sling is the womb; if he were to remove the pan from the sling, he would strike the embryo from the womb; the sling has six ropes; man is sixfold [1], the body, the head, four limbs; verily in himself he bears it.</p>

<p>Prajapati piled the fire as the year by the seasons; by the spring he piled its front half, by the summer its right wing, by the rains its tail, by the autumn its left wing, by the winter its middle. By the Brahman class he piled its front half, by the lordly class its right wing, by cattle its tail, by the people its left wing, by hope its middle. He who knowing thus piles the fire piles it with the seasons; verily he wins all [1]; they hearken to him who has piled the fire, he eats food, he is resplendent. The first layer is this (earth), the mortar the plants and trees; the second is the atmosphere, the mortar the birds; the third is yonder (sky), the mortar the Naksatras; the fourth the sacrifice, the mortar the sacrificial fee; the fifth the sacrificer, the mortar offspring; if he were to pile it with three layers, he would obstruct the sacrifice, the fee, the self, offspring; therefore should it be piled with five layers; verily he preserves all. In that there [2] are three layers, (it is) since Agni is threefold; in that there are two (more), the sacrificer has two feet, (it is) for support; there are five layers, man is five fold; verily he preserves himself. There are five layers, he covers (them) with five (sets of) mortar, these make up ten, man has ten elements; he preserves man in his full extent.</p>
<p>Again the Viraj has ten elements, the Viraj is food; verily he finds support in the Viraj and the eating of food. The sixth layer is the year, mortar is the seasons; there are six layers, six (sets of) mortar, they make up twelve, the year has twelve months; verily he finds support in the year.<br>

<p>&lsquo;He who piles the fire without regard to the deity falls a victim to the deities; he becomes poorer; he who (piles it) according to the deity does not fall a victim to the deities; he becomes richer. With a Gayatri (verse) addressed to Agni should he stroke the first layer; with a Tristubh the second; with a Jagati the third; with an Anustubh the fourth; with a Pankti the fifth; verily he piles the fire according to the deity. He falls not a victim to the deities; he becomes richer. This is the dividing of the sacrificial food; the food is cattle, and he piles it with cattle [1].</p>
<h5 id="b-241">b</h5>
<p>He who piles the fire after announcing to Prajapati does not go to ruin. The horses should stand on either side, on the left the black, on the right the white; having offered them he should put down the bricks; that is the form of Prajapati, the horse is connected with Prajapati; verily having announced to Prajapati in real presence he piles the fire, he does not go to ruin; the white horse is the form of day, the black of night; the bricks are the form of day [2], the mortar of night; when about to put down the bricks he should stroke the white horse, when about to put down the mortar he should</p>
<p>stroke the black; verily with the days and nights he piles it.</p>
<h5 id="c-207">c</h5>
<p>A golden vessel full of honey he gives, (saying), &lsquo;May I be possessed of honey&rsquo;; with (a verse) addressed to Surya, containing the word &lsquo;brilliant&rsquo;, he should gaze (on it); verily it becomes brilliant in the midday; he causes the horse to sniff it; Indra is yonder sun, Prajapati is he; the horse is connected with Prajapati; verily he wins him straightway.</p>

<p>To thee, O Agni, the bull, the wise,<br>
I have come, generating thee ever new;<br>
Be our household rites not halting;<br>
With thy keen holy power sharpen us.<br>
The bricks are cattle, in each layer he puts down a bull (brick); verily in his sacrifice he makes a pairing for propagation; therefore in every herd there is a bull.</p>
<h5 id="b-242">b</h5>
<p>The image of the year<br>
Which men revere in thee, O night,<br>
Making his offspring rich in heroes,<br>
May he obtain all life.<br>
He puts down this Prajapati (brick) [1]; the sole eighth day is this (earth); in that food is made on the sole eighth day, he wins it thereby; this is the wish cow of Prajapati; verily by it the sacrificer in yonder world milks the fire.</p>
<h5 id="c-208">c</h5>
<p>With the light wherewith the gods went upward,<br>
Wherewith the Adityas, the Vasus, the Rudras,<br>
Wherewith the Angirases attained greatness,<br>
With that let the sacrificer go in prosperity.<br>
The fire is piled for the world of heaven [2]; (with the words) With the light wherewith the gods went upwards&rsquo;, he lights the fire in the pan; verily he puts down the bricks connected with the trees, to win the world of heaven.</p>

<p>(Homage) to the hundred-weaponed, him of a hundred powers,<br>

<p>The four paths going to the gods<br>
Which stretch between sky and earth,<br>

<p>Summer, winter, and spring for us,<br>
Autumn, the rains be favourable for us;<br>

<p>To the Idu year, the complete year, the year<br>

<h5 id="h-156">h</h5>
<p>Better than good have the gods brought together;<br>
With thee as aid may we win thee;<br>
Do thou, wonder-working, O drop [4], enter us,<br>
Be propitious and kindly to our children, our descendants.</p>
<h5 id="i-140">i</h5>
<p>He puts down these unfailing (bricks), they are the gods unconquered; verily he enters them; he is not conquered.</p>
<h5 id="k-133">k</h5>
<p>The theologians say, &lsquo;Since the months, the half-months, the seasons, the years cook the plants, then why is the offering of first-fruits made to other deities?&rsquo; The gods conquered these (plants); if he were to offer to the seasons, he would cause strife with the gods; having offered the offering of first-fruits, he offers these libations; verily he delights the half-months, the months, the seasons, the year; he does not cause strife with the gods. &lsquo;Better than good have the gods brought together&rsquo;, he says, for the eating of the offering, to prevent the defeat of the sacrificer.</p>
<h4 id="03-31">03</h4>
<h5 id="a-249">a</h5>
<p>Thou art the thunderbolt of Indra, slaying foes;<br>
Guarding our bodies, lying in wait;<br>
He who in east, south, west,<br>
In the north, as a foe plots against us,<br>
May he strike on this rock.<br>
The gods and the Asuras were in conflict; the Asuras sought to force them from the quarters; the gods repelled them with arrow and thunder bolt; in that he puts down the thunderbolt (bricks), he repels his foes with arrow and thunderbolt; in the quarters [1] he puts down; verily he puts round him those citadels of the gods, which guard the body.</p>
<h5 id="b-243">b</h5>
<p>O Agni and Visnu,<br>
May these songs gladden you in unison;<br>
Come ye with radiance and strength.<br>
The theologians say, &lsquo;Since they do not offer to any deity, then what deity has the stream of wealth?&rsquo; Wealth is Agni, this stream is his; wealth is Visnu, this stream is his; with a verse addressed to Agni and Visnu he offers the stream of wealth; verily he unites them with their proper portions; verily also [2] he makes this libation to have an abode; he wins that for desire of which he makes this offering. The fire is Rudra; now two are his bodies, the dread the one, the auspicious the other; in that he offers the Çatarudriya, he soothes with it his dread form; in that he offers the stream of wealth, he delights with it his auspicious form. He, who knows the support of the stream of wealth [3], finds support. If there is any butter left over, in it he should cook a mess for the Brahmans, four Brahmans should eat it; the Brahman is Agni Vaiśvanara, Vaiśvanara, is the form dear to Agni; verily he establishes it in his dear form. He should give four cows; verily with them the sacrificer in yonder world milks the fire.</p>
<h4 id="04-32">04</h4>
<h5 id="a-250">a</h5>
<p>&lsquo;To thought I offer with mind, with ghee&rsquo;, he says; the oblation to Viśvakarman is called the undeceivable; the foe cannot deceive him who has piled; verily also he wins the gods.</p>
<h5 id="b-244">b</h5>
<p>&lsquo;O Agni, to-day&rsquo;, (with these words) he offers with a Pankti verse, and by the Pankti and the libation he grasps the beginning of the sacrifice.<br>
C &lsquo;Seven are thy kindling-sticks, O Agni; seven thy tongues&rsquo;, he says; verily he wins the Hotr&rsquo;s offices. Agni went away from the gods, desiring a portion [1]; to him they assigned this as a portion; that is the Agnihotra, of Agni; then is he born indeed when he is completely piled. Verily to him on birth he gives food; he delighted delights him, he becomes richer.</p>
<h5 id="d-198">d</h5>
<p>The theologians say, &lsquo;Since it is as the Garhapatya that (the fire) is piled, then where is its Ahavaniya?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yonder sun&rsquo;, he should reply, for in it they offer to all the gods [2]. He who knowing thus piles the fire straightway makes pleased the gods.</p>
<h5 id="e-185">e</h5>
<p>O Agni, the glorious, lead him to glory;<br>
Bring hither the fame that is Indra&rsquo;s;<br>
May he be head, overlord, resplendent,<br>
Most famed of his equals.<br>
With look auspicious first they underwent<br>
Fervour and consecration, the seers who found the heavenly light;</p>
<p>Thence was born the kingly power, might and force;<br>
May the gods in unison accord that to us.<br>
Disposer, ordainer, and highest [3] onlooker,<br>
Prajapati, supreme lord, the ruler;<br>
The Stomas, the metres, the Nivids, mine they call;<br>
To him may we secure the kingdom.<br>
Turn towards me, come to me;<br>
May he be your ruler, your overlord;<br>
On his discernment do ye depend;<br>
Upon him henceforth do ye all serve.<br>
He puts down these supporters of the realm; this is the realm supporting piling of the fire; verily with it he bestows on him the kingly power, he becomes the kingly power, the kingly power does not fall away from him.</p>
<h4 id="05-32">05</h4>
<h5 id="a-251">a</h5>
<p>Just as a son born dies, so dies he whose fire in the pan is extinguished. If he were to make it by friction, he would divide (the fire), he would produce a foe for him. It must again be kindled (with wood) around; verily he produces it from its own birthplace, he does not produce a foe for him. Darkness seizes on him whose fire in the pan is extinguished, darkness is death; a black garment, a black heifer are the sacrificial fees; verily with darkness [1] he smites away the darkness which is death. Gold he gives, gold is light; verily with the light he smites away the darkness; moreover gold is brilliance; verily he confers brilliance upon himself.</p>
<h5 id="b-245">b</h5>
<p>Like heavenly light, the heat; hail! Like heavenly light, the Arka hail! Like heavenly light, the bright; hail! Like heavenly light, the light; hail! Like heavenly light, the sun; hail!'<br>
The fire is Arka, the horse sacrifice is yonder sun [2]; in that he offers these libations he unites the lights of the Arka and the horse sacrifice; he indeed is an offerer of the Arka and the horse sacrifice, for whom this is done in the fire.</p>
<h5 id="c-209">c</h5>
<p>The waters were first this world, the moving; Prajapati saw this first layer, it he put down, it became this (earth). To him Viśvakarman said, &lsquo;Let me come to thee&rsquo;; &lsquo;There is no space here&rsquo;, he answered [3]. He saw this second layer, he put it down, it became the atmosphere. The sacrifice said to Prajapati, &lsquo;Let me come to thee&rsquo;; &lsquo;There is no space here&rsquo;, he answered. He said to Viśvakarman, &lsquo;Let me come to thee.&rsquo; &lsquo;In what way wilt thou come to me? ' &lsquo;By the regional (bricks)&rsquo;, he replied. He came with the regional (bricks), he put them down, they became the regions [4]. The supreme lord said to Prajapati, &lsquo;Let me come to thee&rsquo;; &lsquo;There is no space here&rsquo;, he answered. He said to Viśvakarman and the sacrifice, &lsquo;Let me come to you two&rsquo;; &lsquo;There is no space here&rsquo;, they answered. He saw this third layer, he put it down, it became yonder (world). Aditya said to Prajapati, &lsquo;Let me come to thee&rsquo; [5]; &lsquo;There is no space here&rsquo;, he answered. He said to Viśvakarman and the sacrifice, &lsquo;Let me come to you two&rsquo;; &lsquo;There is no space here&rsquo;, they answered. He said to the supreme lord, &lsquo;Let me come to thee.&rsquo; &lsquo;In what way wilt thou come to me?&rsquo; &lsquo;By the space-filler&rsquo;, he replied. He came to him by the space filler; therefore the space-filler is unexhausted, for yonder Aditya is unexhausted [6]. To them the seers said, &lsquo;Let us come to you.&rsquo; &lsquo;In what way will ye come?&rsquo; &lsquo;By greatness&rsquo;, they replied. To them they came with two (more) layers; (the fire) became one of five layers. He who knowing thus piles the fire becomes greater, he conquers these worlds, the gods know him; moreover he attains community with these deities.</p>

<p>The fire is a bird; if the piler of the fire were to eat of a bird, he would be eating the fire, he would go to ruin. For a year should he observe the vow, for a vow goes not beyond a year.</p>

<p>The fire is an animal; now an animal destroys him who moves up to it face to face; therefore he should go up to it from behind while it is looking towards the front, to prevent injury to himself.</p>

Heavenly light art thou, grant me heavenly light, restrain the heavenly light, guard me from the sky&rsquo;, he says; by these are these worlds supported; in that he puts them down, (it is) for the support of these worlds. Having put down the naturally perforated (bricks) he puts down the gold bricks; the naturally perforated are these worlds, gold is light; in that having put down the naturally perforated [2] he puts down the gold bricks; verily he makes these worlds full of light by means of them; verily also by them these worlds shine forth for him.</p>

<p>He who having piled the fire steps on it is liable to go to ruin. &lsquo;To thee I come praising with holy power&rsquo;; with this verse addressed to Varuna [4] should he offer; that is the soothing of the fire and the protection of himself.</p>
<h5 id="f-177">f</h5>
<p>He who piles the fire is made into an offering; just as an offering spills, so he spills who having piled the fire approaches a woman; with clotted curds for Mitra and Varuna he should sacrifice; verily he approaches unity with Mitra and Varuna, to avoid his spilling.</p>

<p>He who knows the fire to rest on the seasons, for him the seasons go in order; he finds support. The fire resting on the seasons is the year [5]; the head is the spring, the right side summer, the tail the rains, the left side autumn, the middle winter, the layers the first half-months, the mortar the second half-months, the bricks the days and nights; this is the fire resting on the seasons; he who knows thus, for him the seasons go in order; he finds support.</p>

<h2 id="6-the-explanation-of-the-soma-sacrifice">6 THE EXPLANATION OF THE SOMA SACRIFICE</h2>
<h3 id="i-the-exposition-of-the-soma-sacrifce">I The Exposition of the Soma Sacrifce</h3>
<h4 id="01-31">01</h4>
<p>He makes a hall with beams pointing east. The gods and men divided the quarters, the gods (obtained) the eastern, the Pitrs the southern, men the western, the Rudras the northern. In that he makes a hall with beams pointing east, the sacrificer approaches the world of the gods. He covers it over, for the world of the gods is hidden from the world of men. &lsquo;It is not easy&rsquo;, they say, &lsquo;to go from this world; for who knows if he is in yonder world or not.&rsquo; He makes at the corners apertures [1], for the winning of both worlds. He shaves his hair and beard, he trims his nails. The hair and the beard are dead and impure skin, and by thus destroying the dead and impure skin he becomes fit for the sacrifice and approaches the sacrifice. The Angirases going to the world of heaven placed in the waters consecration and penance. He bathes in the waters; verily visibly he secures consecration and penance. He bathes at a ford, for at a ford did they place (consecration and penance); he bathes at a ford [2]; verily he becomes a ford for his fellows. He sips water; verily he becomes pure within. He consecrates him with a garment; the linen garment has Soma for its deity. He who consecrates himself approaches Soma as his deity. He says, &lsquo;Thou art the body of Soma; guard my body.&rsquo; He approaches his own deity; verily also he invokes this blessing. (Of the garment) the place where the border is belongs to Agni, the wind-guard to Vayu, the fringe to the Pitrs, the foreedge to the plants [3], the warp to the Adityas, the woof to the All-gods, the meshes to the Naksatras. The garment is thus connected with all the gods; in that he consecrates him with the garment, verily with all the gods he consecrates him. Man has breath without; his eating is his breath, he eats; verily he consecrates himself with breath. He becomes satiated. As great as is his breath, with it he approaches the sacrifice. Ghee pertains to the gods, sour cream to the Pitrs, well-seasoned butter to men [4], fresh butter is connected with all the gods; verily in anointing with fresh butter he satisfies all the gods. The man who is consecrated has fallen from this world and yet not gone to the world of the gods; fresh butter is as it were midway; therefore he anoints with fresh butter, along the hair, with a Yajus, for destruction. Indra slew Vrtra; his eyeball fell away; it became collyrium. When he anoints, verily he takes away the eye of his enemy. He anoints his right eye first [5], for men anoint the left first. He does not rub (the ointment) on, for men rub (the ointment) on. Five times he anoints; the Pankti has five syllables, the sacrifice is fivefold; verily he obtains the sacrifice. He anoints a limited number of times, for men anoint an unlimited number of times. He anoints with (a stalk) which has a tuft, for men anoint with (a stalk) which has no tuft; (verily he anoints them) for discrimination. If he were to anoint with (a stalk) having no tuft, he would be as it were a thunder bolt. He anoints with one which has a tuft, for friendship [6]. Indra slew Vrtra, he died upon the waters. Of the waters what was fit for sacrifice, pure, and divine, that went out of the waters, and became Darbha grass. In that he purifies (the sacrificer) with bunches of Darbha grass, verily he purifies him with the waters which are fit for sacrifice, pure, and divine. He purifies (him) with two (stalks); verily he purifies him by days and nights. He purifies (him) with three (stalks); three are these worlds; verily he purifies him by these worlds. He purifies (him) with five stalks [7]; the Pankti has five syllables, the sacrifice is fivefold; verily he purifies him by the sacrifice. He purifies (him) with six (stalks); six are the seasons; verily he purifies him by the seasons. He purifies (him) with seven (stalks); seven are the metres; verily he purifies him by the metres. He purifies (him) with nine (stalks); nine are the breaths in man; verily he purifies him along with his breaths. He purifies (him) with twenty-one (stalks); there are ten fingers and ten toes, and the body is the twenty</p>
<p>first; he thus completely purifies the man [8]. He says, &lsquo;Let the lord of thought purify thee&rsquo;; the mind is the lord of thought; verily by the mind he purifies him. He says, &lsquo;Let the lord of speech purify thee&rsquo;; verily by speech he purifies him. He says, &lsquo;Let the god Savitr purify thee&rsquo;; verily being instigated by Savitr, he purifies him. He says, &lsquo;O lord of the purifier, with thy purifier, for whatsoever I purify myself, that may I have strength to accomplish.&rsquo; Verily does he invoke this blessing.</p>
<h4 id="02-31">02</h4>
<p>All the gods who purified themselves for the sacrifice waxed great. He who knowing thus purifies himself for the sacrifice waxes great. Having purified him without he makes him go within. Verily having purified him in the world of men, he leads him forward purified to the world of the gods. &lsquo;He is not consecrated by one oblation &lsquo;, they say; verily he offers four with the dipping-ladle for consecration; the fifth he offers with the offering-ladle; the Pankti has five syllables, the sacrifice is fivefold; verily he wins the sacrifice. &lsquo;To the purpose, to the impulse, to Agni, [1] hail!&rsquo; he says, for with purpose does a man employ the sacrifice, planning to sacrifice. &lsquo;To wisdom, to thought, to Agni, hail!&rsquo; he says, for by wisdom and thought man approaches the sacrifice. &lsquo;To Sarasvati, to Pusan, to Agni, hail! &lsquo;he says. Sarasvati is speech, Pusan the earth;. verily with speech and the earth he performs the sacrifice. &lsquo;O ye divine, vast, all-soothing waters&rsquo;, he says. The waters of the rain [2] are the divine, vast, all-soothing waters; if he said not that praise, the divine waters would descend in anger on this world. He says, &lsquo;O ye divine, vast, all-soothing waters.&rsquo; Verily he makes them soothing for this world; accordingly being soothed they approach this world. &lsquo;Heaven and earth&rsquo;, he says, for the sacrifice is in heaven and earth. &lsquo;Wide atmosphere&rsquo;, he says, for the sacrifice is in the atmosphere. &lsquo;May Brhaspati rejoice in our oblation&rsquo; [3], he says. Brhaspati is the holy power (Brahman) of the gods; verily by the holy power he wins this sacrifice for him. If he were to say vidheh then he would stumble on the sacrificial post; he says vrdhatu; verily he avoids the sacrificial post. Prajapati created the sacrifice. Being created it went away. It crushed the Yajus, it crushed the Saman; the Rc raised it; in that the Rc raised (it), hence the elevating offering has the name. With a Rc [4] he sacrifices, to support the sacrifice. &lsquo;It was the Anustubh among the metres which supported it&rsquo;, they say. Therefore he sacrifices with an Anustubh, to support the sacrifice. &lsquo;It was the twelve &ldquo;calf-binders&rdquo; which supported it&rsquo;, they say. Therefore with twelve those who know the &lsquo;calf-binders&rsquo;, consecrate. This Rc is an Anustubh; the Anustubh is speech; in that he consecrates him with this Rc, he consecrates him with the whole of speech. &lsquo;Let every (man) of the god who leads &lsquo;, he says. By that (the Rc) is connected with Savitr. &lsquo;(Let every) man choose the companionship&rsquo; [5], he says. By that (the Rc) has the Pitrs for its deity.&rsquo; &lsquo;Every man prayeth for wealth&rsquo;, he says. By that (the Rc) is connected with the All-gods. &lsquo;Let him choose glory that he may prosper&rsquo;, he says. By that (the Rc) is connected with Pusan. This Rc indeed is connected with all the gods. In that he consecrates with this Rc, he consecrates him with all the gods. The first quarter verse is of seven syllables; the other three are of eight syllables. The three approach the eight; the four the eight. Because it has eight syllables [6] it is a Gayatri. Because it has eleven syllables it is a Tristubh. Because it has twelve syllables, it is a Jagati. This Rc indeed is all the metres. In that he consecrates him with this Rc, he consecrates him with all the metres. The first quarter verse is of seven syllables; the Çakvari is of seven syllables, the Çakvari is cattle; verily he wins cattle. The first quarter-verse is defective by one syllable. Therefore men live on what of speech is defective. He offers with a full (verse) to win Prajapati; full as it were is Prajapati. He offers with a defective (verse), for the creation of offspring, for from what is defective Prajapati created offspring.</p>
<h4 id="03-32">03</h4>
<p>The Rc and the Saman, unwilling to remain with the gods for the sacrifice, taking the form of a black antelope departed and remained away. The (gods) reflected, &lsquo;He whom they shall resort to will become all this world.&rsquo; They called to them, and they depositing their might in day and night came up to them. This is the colour of the Rc, the white of the skin of the black antelope; the black is the colour of the Saman. &lsquo;Ye are images of the Rc and Saman&rsquo;, he says; verily he wins the Rc and the Saman [1]. The white of the black antelope skin is the colour of the day, the black of the night.</p>
<p>Whatever is imbued in those two, he wins. He consecrates (him) with a black antelope skin. The black antelope skin is the form of the holy power; verily he consecrates him with the holy power. &lsquo;O god, this prayer of him who imploreth&rsquo;, he says. That is according to the text. The man who is consecrated is a foetus; the clothing is the caul; be covers. Therefore [2] foetuses are born covered (with the caul). He should not uncover before the purchasing of the Soma. If he were to uncover before the purchasing of the Soma, the foetuses of offspring would be liable to miscarriage. He uncovers when the Soma has been purchased; verily he is born. It is also as when one uncovers to a superior. The Angirases going to the world of heaven divided their strength. What was left over became Çara grass; Çara grass is strength. In that the girdle is of Çara grass [3], he wins strength. He girds it in the middle; verily he gives him strength in the middle. Therefore in the middle men enjoy strength. The part of man above the navel is pure, that below is impure. In that he girds him in the middle he discriminates between the pure and impure parts. Indra hurled his thunderbolt against Vrtra; it divided into three parts; one-third the wooden sword, one-third the chariot, and one-third the sacrificial post [4]. The internal arrows which were split (aśiryanta) became Çara grass, and that is why Çara grass is so called. The thunderbolt is Çara grass; hunger indeed is the foe of man. In that the girdle is of Çara grass, he clearly drives away the enemy hunger from the middle (of man&rsquo;s body). It is threefold. The breath is threefold; verily he places the threefold breath in the middle of the sacrificer. It is broad, for the discrimination of the strands. He consecrates the sacrificer with a girdle, with a yoke his wife, for the sake of offspring [5]. The sacrifice reflected on the gift (to the priests). He had intercourse with her. Indra perceived this and reflected, &lsquo;He who will be born from this union will be this world.&rsquo; He entered her; from her verily was Indra born; he reflected, &lsquo;He who hence other than I will be born will be this world&rsquo;. Stroking her womb he split it, she became barren after birth, and that is the origin of the (cow) which is barren after birth [6]. He wrapped it (the yoni) in his hand, he deposited it among the wild beasts, it became the horn of the black antelope. &lsquo;Thou art the birthplace of Indra; harm me not&rsquo;, (with these words) he hands the horn of the black antelope. Verily he makes the sacrifice united with the womb, the gift with the womb, Indra with the womb, for union with the womb. &lsquo;For ploughing thee, for good crops&rsquo;, he says. Therefore plants grow up without ploughing. &lsquo;For those of good fruits thee, for the plants&rsquo;, he says. Therefore plants bear fruit. If he were to scratch himself with his hand [7] his offspring would be liable to the itch; if he were to smile, they would become naked. He scratches himself with the horn of the black antelope and smiles, holding it for the protection of his offspring. He should not let go the horn of the black antelope before the bringing of the gifts (to the priests). If he were to let go the horn of the black antelope before the bringing of the gifts, the womb of his offspring will be liable to miscarriage. When the gifts have been brought, he casts away the horn of the black antelope in the pit. The pit is the womb of the sacrificer; the horn of the black antelope is the womb; verily he places womb in womb, that the sacrificer may have a womb.</p>
<h4 id="04-33">04</h4>
<p>Speech went away from the gods, not being willing to serve for the sacrifice. She entered the trees. It is the voice of the trees, the voice that is heard in the drum, the lute, and the flute. In that he offers the staff of the initiated, he wins speech. The (staff) is of Udumbara wood; the, Udumbara is strength; verily he wins strength. It is level with his mouth; verily from the mouth (downwards) he wins strength for him. Therefore from the mouth they enjoy strength [1]. After the buying of the Soma he hands the staff to the Maitravaruna (priest). For the Maitravaruna first assigns to the priests their utterance, and the priests plant it in the sacrificer. &lsquo;Hail! with my mind the sacrifice&rsquo;, he says; for man approaches the sacrifice with his mind. &lsquo;Hail! from heaven and earth&rsquo;, he says; for the sacrifice is in heaven and earth. &lsquo;Hail! from the broad atmosphere&rsquo;, he says; for the sacrifice is in the atmosphere. &lsquo;Hail! from the wind the sacrifice I grasp&rsquo;, he says [2]. The sacrifice is he who blows here; verily he clearly wins him. He clenches his fist; he restrains his speech, for the support of the sacrifice. &lsquo;This Brahman has consecrated himself&rsquo;, he says thrice in a whisper; verily he proclaims him to the gods. Thrice aloud (he says it); verily he proclaims him to both gods and men. He should not utter speech until the Naksatras appear. If he were to utter speech before the Naksatras appear, he would divide the sacrifice [3]. When the Naksatras have arisen, be utters speech, &lsquo;Prepare the fast food.&rsquo; The consecrated is bound by a vow of sacrifice; verily with regard to the sacrifice does he</p>
<p>utter speech. Should he utter speech, he should then repeat a Rc addressed to Visnu. Visnu is the sacrifice; verily he unites the sacrifice with the sacrifice. &lsquo;The thought divine we meditate&rsquo;, he says. Thus he makes smooth the sacrifice. &lsquo;May it guide us safely according as we will&rsquo;, he says. Verily he wins the dawn [4]. The theologians say, &lsquo;Should an offering be made in the house of one who is consecrated, or should an offering not be made?&rsquo; The man who is consecrated is the oblation, and if he were to sacrifice he would offer a part of the sacrificer; if he were not to sacrifice, then he would omit a joint of the sacrifice. &lsquo;The gods, mind born, mind using&rsquo;, he says. The gods, mind born, mind using, are the breaths; verily in them he sacrifices secretly, and the sacrifice is both offered as it were and yet not offered. Now the Raksases are fain to hurt him who is consecrated while he sleeps. Agni [5] indeed is the slayer of the Raksases. &lsquo;O Agni, be thou wakeful. Let us be glad&rsquo;, he says; verily having made Agni his guardian, for the smiting away of the Raksases, he sleeps. Now, if a man who is consecrated sleeps, he does something that as it were is contrary to his vow. I Thou, O Agni, art the guardian of vows&rsquo;, he says. Agni indeed is among the gods the guardian of vows; verily he causes him to take up his vow again. &lsquo;Among the gods and men&rsquo;, he says for he, being a god [6], is (guardian of vows) among men. &lsquo;Thou art to be invoked at our sacrifices&rsquo;, he says; for him they invoke at the sacrifices. Now power and the gods depart from the man who is consecrated when he is asleep. &lsquo;All the gods have surrounded me&rsquo;, he says; verily he unites him with both power and the gods. If he were not to utter that formula (Yajus), so many cattle would be as he might consecrate himself for. &lsquo;O Soma, give so much [7] and bear more hither&rsquo;, he says; verily he obtains innumerable cattle. &lsquo;Thou art gold; be for my enjoyment&rsquo;, he says; verily he takes each according to its deity. He says, &lsquo;To Vayu thee, to Varuna thee!&rsquo; If he did not so specify them, he would put the gifts out of correspondence with the deities, and would be brought low to the deities. Because he thus specifies them, he puts the gifts in correspondence with the deities, and is not brought low to the deities. &lsquo;O divine waters, son of the waters&rsquo;, he says. &lsquo;That divine part of yours, which is pure and fit for the sacrifice, may I not step upon&rsquo;, that he says in effect. &lsquo;The unbroken web of earth may I follow&rsquo;, he says; verily making a bridge he crosses over.</p>
<h4 id="05-33">05</h4>
<p>The gods, having fixed up a place of sacrifice, could not distinguish the quarters. They ran up to one another, (saying) &lsquo;By thee shall we distinguish them, by thee.&rsquo; They fixed upon Aditi, (saying, &lsquo;By thee shall we distinguish them.&rsquo; She said, &lsquo;Let me choose a guerdon. Let the opening oblation in the sacrifice be mine, and the concluding oblation be mine.&rsquo; Therefore the opening oblation of the sacrifice belongs to Aditi, and the concluding oblation belongs to Aditi. He offers to five gods; there are five quarters, (and so it serves) for the distinction of the quarters [1]. Now the Pankti is of five elements, the sacrifice is fivefold; verily he wins the sacrifice. They made sacrifice to Pathya Svasti. The eastern quarter they distinguished by her, by Agni the southern, by Soma the western, by Savitr the northern, by Aditi the zenith. He offers to Pathya Svasti; verily he distinguishes the eastern quarter. Having offered to Pathya Svasti, he offers to Agni and Soma. Agni and Soma indeed are the eyes of the sacrificer; verily he sees with them [2]. Having offered to Agni and Soma, he offers to Savitr; verily on the instigation of Savitr he sees. Having offered to Savitr, he offers to Aditi; Aditi indeed is this (earth); verily taking his stand on it he sees. Having offered to Aditi, he repeats the verse to the Maruts. The Maruts are the subjects of the gods. As the subjects of the gods are in harmony, so he brings the human subjects into harmony.&rsquo; In that he repeats the verse to the Maruts, it is to bring subjects into harmony. The theologians say, &lsquo;The opening oblation should be performed with a fore-offering, but without an after-offering; the concluding oblation should be performed with all after-offering [3], but without a fore-offering.&rsquo; These are the fore-offerings, and these the after-offerings, and this is the course of the sacrifice. This is not to be followed. The fore offerings are the self; the after-offerings the offspring. If he were to omit the fore-offerings, he would omit the self; if he were to omits the after-offerings, he would omit offspring. In so far as the whole of the sacrifice is not performed, in so far does the sacrifice come to ruin, and the sacrificer comes to ruin along with the sacrifice [4]. Verily the opening oblation should be performed with both fore- and after-offerings, and the concluding oblation should be performed both with fore- and after offerings. He does not omit the self, nor offspring; the sacrifice does not come to ruin, nor the sacrificer. He offers the concluding oblation in the scrapings of the opening oblation; this is the</p>
<p>course of the sacrifice. Now if he were to make the Yajya verses of the opening libation the Yajya verses of the concluding libation, he would mount to the other world away from this, and would be liable to die. The Puronuvakya verses of the opening libation should be made the Yajya verses of the concluding libation; verily he finds support in this world.</p>
<h4 id="06-33">06</h4>
<p>Kadru and Suparni had a dispute (for the stake of) each other&rsquo;s form. Kadru defeated Suparni. She said, &lsquo;In the third heaven from here is the Soma; fetch it, and by it buy your release.&rsquo; Kadru is this (earth), Suparni yonder (heaven), the descendants of Suparni the metres. She said, &lsquo;For this do parents rear children; &ldquo;in the third heaven from here is the Soma; fetch it, and by it buy your release&rdquo; [1], so has Kadru said to me.&rsquo; The Jagati flew up, of fourteen syllables, but returned without obtaining it; it lost two syllables, but returned with the (sacrificial) animals and consecration. Therefore the Jagati is the richest in cattle of the metres, and consecration waits upon a man who is rich in cattle. The Tristubh flew up, of thirteen syllables, but returned without obtaining it; it lost two syllables, but returned with the (sacrificial) gifts [2] and penance. Therefore in the world of the Tristubh, the midday oblation, the gifts are brought. &lsquo;That in truth is penance&rsquo;, they say, &lsquo;if a man gives his wealth.&rsquo; The Gayatri flew up, of four syllables, together with a female goat with light. Then the goat won (Soma) for her, and so the goat has the name. The Gayatri brought back the Soma and the four syllables, and so became of eight syllables. The theologians say [3], &lsquo;For what reason is it that the Gayatri, the smallest of the metres, holds the forefront of the sacrifice?&rsquo; Because it brought down the Soma, it held the forefront of the sacrifice; therefore it is the most glorious (of the metres). By the feet it grasped two of the oblations, and by the mouth one. The one it grasped by the mouth it sucked; therefore two oblations are made of the pure Soma, the morning and midday oblations; therefore at the third oblation they pour out the dregs of the Soma; for they regard it as sucked as it were [4]. He removes any admixture so that it may be pure; verily also he makes ready it (the rjisa). When the Soma was being borne away, the Gandharva Viśvavasu stole it. It was for three nights stolen; therefore after purchase the Soma is kept for three nights. The gods said, &lsquo;The Gandharvas love women; let us redeem it with a woman.&rsquo; They made speech unto a woman of one year old, and with her redeemed it. She adopted the form of a deer and ran away from the Gandharvas [5] that was the origin of the deer. The gods said, &lsquo;She has run from you; she comes not to us; let us both summon her.&rsquo; The Gandharvas uttered a spell, the gods sang, she went to the gods as they sang. Therefore women love one who sings; enamoured are women of him who thus knows. So if there is in a family one person who knows thus, men give their daughters in wedlock to that family, even if there be other (wooers) in plenty [6]. He buys Soma with a (cow) one year old; verily he buys it with the whole of speech. Therefore men utter speech when one year old. He buys with a cow which has no horns, small ears, is not one-eyed or lame, and has not seven hooves; verily he buys it with all. If he were to buy it with a white cow, the sacrificer would become leprous. If he were to buy with a black one, it would be a funeral cow, and the sacrificer would be likely to die. If with one of both colours, it would be one sacred to Vrtrahan, and he would either overcome his foe or his foe him. He buys with a ruddy, yellow-eyed one. This is the form of Soma; verily he buys it with its own deity.</p>
<h4 id="07-32">07</h4>
<p>That became gold. Therefore they purify gold forth from the waters. The theologians say, &lsquo;How is it that offspring are produced through that which is boneless, and yet are born with bones?&rsquo; Because he offers the gold, placing it in the ghee, therefore are offspring produced, through that which is boneless, and yet are born with bones. The ghee is Agni&rsquo;s loved abode, the gold, is radiance. &lsquo;This is thy body, O pure one. This is thy splendour&rsquo;, he says; verily he unites Agni with his radiance and his body [1]; verily also he makes him ready. If he were to deposit (the gold) without fastening it on, then the foetuses of offspring would be liable to miscarriage. He deposits it fastening it on, to secure the foetuses. He fastens it so that it cannot be untied, for the production of offspring. The cow with which the Soma is bought is speech. &lsquo;Thou art the strong&rsquo;, he says; for what he strengthens in his mind, that he expresses in speech. &lsquo;Grasped by mind&rsquo;, he says; for by mind is speech grasped.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Acceptable to Visnu he says [2]. Visnu is the sacrifice; verily be makes her accept able to the sacrifice. &lsquo;Through the impulse of thee, of true impulse&rsquo;, he says; verily he wins speech which is impelled by Savitr. As each part is performed, the Raksases are fain to injure the sacrifice; the path of Agni and Surya is one which the Raksases cannot injure. &lsquo;I have mounted the eye of the sun, the pupil of the eye of Agni&rsquo;, he says. He mounts the path which is not injured by the Raksases [3]. The cow with which the Soma is bought is speech. &lsquo;Thou art thought, thou art mind&rsquo;, he says; verily he instructs her. Therefore children are born instructed. &lsquo;Thou art thought&rsquo;, he says, for what one thinks in the mind one expresses in speech. &lsquo;Thou art mind&rsquo;, he says; for what one grasps by the mind one performs. &lsquo;Thou art meditation&rsquo;, he says; for what one meditates with the mind one expresses in speech [4]. &lsquo;Thou art the gift (to the priests)&rsquo;, he says; for (the cow) is the gift. &lsquo;Thou art of the sacrifice&rsquo;, he says; verily he makes her fit for the sacrifice. &lsquo;Thou art of kingly power&rsquo;, he says, for she is of kingly power. &lsquo;Thou art Aditi, double-headed&rsquo;, he says. In that to Aditi belong the opening and the concluding oblations of the sacrifices, therefore does he say that. If (the cow) were not bound, she would be unrestrained; if she were bound by the foot, she would be the funeral cow, and the sacrificer would be likely to perish [5]. If she were held by the ears, she would belong to Vrtrahan, and the sacrificer would oppress another, or another would oppress him. &lsquo;May Mitra bind thee by the foot&rsquo;, he says. Mitra is the auspicious one of the gods; verily with his help he binds her by the foot. &lsquo;May Pusan guard the ways&rsquo;, he says. Pusan is this (earth); verily he makes her lady of this (earth), for the gaining thereof. &lsquo;For Indra the guardian!&rsquo; he says; verily he makes Indra her guardian [6]. &lsquo;May thy mother approve, thy father&rsquo;, he says; verily he buys with her approved. &lsquo;Go, O goddess, to the god&rsquo;, he says; for she is a goddess, and Soma is a god. &lsquo;To Indra Soma&rsquo;, he says; for the Soma is borne to Indra. If he were not to say that text, the cow with which the Soma is bought would go away. &lsquo;May Rudra guide thee hither&rsquo;, he says. Rudra is the harsh [7] one of the gods; verily he places him below her, for guiding hither. He does as it were a harsh thing when he recites that (text) of Rudra&rsquo;s. &lsquo;In the path of Mitra&rsquo;, he says, for soothing. He buys indeed by speech when he buys by the cow with which the Soma is bought. Hail! Return with Soma as thy comrade, with wealth&rsquo;, he says, verily having purchased by means of speech, he restores speech to himself. The speech of him who knows thus is not likely to fail.</p>
<h4 id="08-31">08</h4>
<p>He follows six steps. Speech does not speak beyond the sixth day. He wins speech in the size in which she is found in the path of the year. He offers in the seventh footprint. The Çakvari has seven feet, the Çakvari is cattle; verily he wins cattle. There are seven domesticated animals, and seven wild; there are seven metres to win both sets of animals. &lsquo;Thou art a Vasvi, thou art a Rudra&rsquo;, he says; verily thus by her form he expounds her greatness [1]. &lsquo;May Brhaspati make thee rejoice in happiness&rsquo;, he says. Brhaspati is the holy power of the gods; verily by means of the holy power be wins cattle for him. &lsquo;May Rudra with the Vasus be favourable to thee&rsquo;, he says, for the sake of protection. &lsquo;I pour thee on the head of the earth, on the place of sacrifice&rsquo;, he says; for the place of sacrifice is the head of the earth. &lsquo;On the abode of the offering&rsquo;, he says; for the foot of the cow by which the Soma is bought is the abode of the offering. &lsquo;Rich in ghee; hail!&rsquo; [2], he says. Because it was from her foot that ghee was pressed out, he says thus. If the Adhvaryu were to offer a libation where there were no fire, the Adhvaryu would become blind, and the Raksases would destroy the sacrifice. He offers after putting down the gold; verily he offers in that which has fire, the Adhvaryu does not become blind, and the Raksases. do not destroy the sacrifice. As each part is performed, the Raksases are fain to injure the sacrifice. &lsquo;The Raksas is enclosed, the evil spirits are enclosed&rsquo;, he says, for the smiting away of the Raksases [3]. &lsquo;Thus I cut the necks of the Raksas&rsquo;; &lsquo;Who hateth us and whom we hate&rsquo;, he says. There are two persons, one whom he hates and one who hates him; verily successively he cuts their necks. The foot of the cow with which the Soma is bought is cattle; he pours (the dust of the footprint) so far as it is mixed with the ghee; verily he wins cattle. (Saying) &lsquo;Ours be wealth&rsquo;, he pours it; verily the Adhvaryu [4] does not deprive himself of cattle. Saying &lsquo;Thine be wealth&rsquo;, he hands it to the sacrificer, and so bestows wealth on the sacrificer. Saying &lsquo;Thine be wealth&rsquo;, (the sacrificer hands it) to his wife. For a wife is the half of oneself, and to do so is as it were to deposit it in one&rsquo;s house. &lsquo;Let me attend on thee with Tvastr&rsquo;s aid&rsquo;, he says. Tvastr is the maker of the forms of offspring, of pairings; verily he places form in cattle. For this world the</p>
<h4 id="09-32">09</h4>
<p>The theologians say, &lsquo;Should the Soma be clarified or not?&rsquo; Soma indeed is the king of plants; whatever falls upon it is swallowed by it. If be were to clarify it, it would be as when one expels from the mouth what has been swallowed; if he were not to clarify it, it would be as when something falls upon the eye and moves to and fro; the Adhvaryu would be hungry, the sacrificer would be hungry. &lsquo;O Soma-seller, purify the Soma&rsquo;, he should say; so whether it be the one [1] or the other &lsquo;. he involves the Soma-seller in both (faults), and therefore the Soma-seller is hungry. Aruna Aupaveśi said, &lsquo;At the buying of the Soma I win the third pressing.&rsquo; He measures (the Soma) on the skin of beasts verily he wins cattle, for cattle are the third pressing. If he desire of a man, &lsquo;May he be without cattle&rsquo;, he should measure it for him on the rough side. The rough side indeed is not connected with cattle; verily he becomes without cattle. If he desire of a man, &lsquo;May he be rich in cattle&rsquo; [2], he should measure for him on the hairy side. That indeed is the form of cattle; verily by the form he obtains cattle for him; verily he becomes rich in cattle. He buys it at the end of the waters; verily he buys it with its sap. &lsquo;Thou art a home dweller&rsquo;, he says; verily he makes it at home. &lsquo;Thy libation is bright&rsquo;, he says; for bright is its libation. He advances (for it) with a cart; verily he advances to its mightiness. He advances with a cart [3], therefore what lives on the level is to be borne by a cart. Where, however, they bear it on their heads, therefore what lives on the hill is to be borne on the head. With a verse, &lsquo;That god, Savitr&rsquo;, in the Atichandas metre he measures. The Atichandas is all the metres; verily with all the metres he measures it. The Atichandas is the highest of the metres. In that he measures with a verse in the Atichandas metre, he makes it the highest of its peers. With each (finger) separately [4] he measures; verily he measures it with each fresh in turn; therefore the fingers have various strengths. He presses down the thumb on them all; therefore it has equal strength with the other fingers; therefore all it accompanies. If he were to measure with all (the fingers), the fingers would grow united; with each separately he measures; therefore they grow separate. He measures five times with the Yajus. The Pankti has five syllables, the sacrifice is fivefold; verily he wins the sacrifice. (He measures) five times in silence [5]. They make up ten. The Viraj has ten syllables, the Viraj is food; verily by the Viraj he wins proper food. In that he measures with the Yajus, he wins the past; in that he measures in silence, the future. Now if there were only so much Soma as that which he measures, there would be enough for the sacrificer only, and not also for the priests in the Sadas. With the words, &lsquo;For offspring thee!&rsquo; he draws (the cloth for the Soma) together; verily he makes the priests in the Sadas share in it; with a garment he ties it up; the garment is connected with all the gods [6]; verily he unites it with all the gods, the Soma is cattle; (with the words) &lsquo;For expiration thee&rsquo;, he ties it; verily he confers expiration upon cattle. (With the words) &lsquo;For cross-breathing thee&rsquo;, he looses it; verily he confers cross-breathing upon cattle; therefore the vital breaths do not desert a sleeper.</p>
<h4 id="10-31">10</h4>
<p>If he were to barter (it) in response (to the words), &lsquo;Let me buy with one-sixteenth (of the cow) from thee, with one-eighth&rsquo;, he would make the Soma not worth a cow, the sacrificer not worth a cow, the Adhvaryu not, worth a cow, but he would not depreciate the mightiness of the cow. &lsquo;With a cow let me buy from thee&rsquo;, verily he should say; verily he makes the Soma worth a cow, the sacrificer worth</p>
<h5 id="a-257">a</h5>
<p>cow, the Adhvaryu worth a cow, yet still he does not depreciate the mightiness of the cow. He buys (it) with a she-goat; verily he buys it full of fervour; he buys (it) with gold; verily he buys it bright [1]; he buys (it) with a milch cow; verily he buys it with milk for the mixing: he buys (it) with a bull; verily he buys it with Indra; he buys (it) with a draught ox, the draught ox is the bearer; verily by the bearer he buys the bearer of the sacrifice; he buys with two as a pair, to win a pair; he buys with a garment, the garment is connected with all the gods; verily he buys it for all the gods. These,, make up ten. The Viraj has ten syllables, the Viraj is food; verily by the Viraj he wins proper food [2]. &lsquo;Thou art the bodily form of penance, Prajapati&rsquo;s kind&rsquo;, he says, verily the Adhvaryu</p>
<p>makes atonement to the cattle, that he may not be cut off. He attains prosperity, be obtains cattle who knows thus. &lsquo;The bright with the bright for thee I buy&rsquo;, he says that is according to the text. The gods retook by force the gold where with they purchased the Soma, saying, &lsquo;Who shall barter brilliance?&rsquo; The gold by which [3] he buys the Soma he should retake by force; verily he bestows brilliance upon himself. &lsquo;Ours be light, darkness be on the Soma seller&rsquo;, he says; verily he places light in the sacrificer, and bestows darkness on the Soma-seller. If he were to strike (the Soma seller) without inter twining (the flock of wool), then the serpents would bite during that year. &lsquo;Thus do I intertwine the necks of the biting serpents&rsquo;, he says; the serpents do not bite that year, he pierces the Soma-seller with darkness. &lsquo;O Svana [4], Bhraja&rsquo;, he says; they indeed in yonder world guarded the Soma; from them they grasped the Soma; if he were not to indicate to them those that serve as the price of Soma, he would not have purchased the Soma, and they would not guard the Sonia for him in yonder world. In that he indicates to them those that serve as the price of Soma, he really purchases the Soma, and they guard the Soma for him in yonder world.</p>
<h4 id="11-31">11</h4>
<p>The Soma when bought and tied up is connected with Varuna. Come as a friend to us, creating firm friendships&rsquo;, he says, for atonement. Enter the right thigh of Indra&rsquo;, he says; the gods placed the Soma which they purchased in the right thigh of Indra; now the sacrificer is Indra; therefore he says thus. &lsquo;With life, with fair life&rsquo;, he says; verily seizing the gods [1] he rises up. &lsquo;Fare along the wide atmosphere&rsquo;, he says; for Soma has the atmosphere for its deity. &lsquo;Thou art the seat of Aditi. Sit on the seat of Aditi&rsquo;, he says; that is according to the text. He severs it indeed when he makes what is connected with Varuna connected with Mitra; he sets it down with a verse addressed to Varuna; verily he unites it with its own deity. He covers it round with a garment, the garment is connected with all the gods; verily with all [2] the gods he unites it, and thus (it serves) for the smiting away of the Raksases. &lsquo;He hath stretched the atmosphere within the woods&rsquo;, he says; for within the woods he stretched the atmosphere. &lsquo;Strength in horses&rsquo;, he says; for (he placed) strength in horses. &lsquo;Milk in kine&rsquo;, he says; for (he placed) milk in kine. &lsquo;Skill in the heart&rsquo;, he says; for (he placed) skill in the heart. &lsquo;Varuna, Agni in dwellings&rsquo;, he says; for Varuna (placed) Agni in dwellings. &lsquo;The sun in the sky&rsquo; [3], he says; for (he placed) the sun in the sky. &lsquo;The Soma in the hill&rsquo;, he says; the hills are the pressing-stones; he places the Soma in them, who sacrifices; therefore he says thus. &lsquo;Thee, all knowing god&rsquo; with this verse addressed to Surya he fastens the black antelope skin, to smite away the Raksases. &lsquo;Come hither, O ye oxen, strong to bear the yoke&rsquo;, he says; that is according to the text. &lsquo;Move forward, O lord of the world&rsquo;, he says; for he is the lord of creatures [4]; &lsquo;to all thy stations&rsquo;, be says; for he moves forward to all his stations. &lsquo;Let no opponent find thee&rsquo;, he says; since the Gandharva Viśvavasu stole the Soma when it was being carried below, he says that, to prevent its being stolen. &lsquo;Thou art the good luck of the sacrificer&rsquo;, he says; verily thus the sacrificer grasps the sacrifice, that it be not interrupted. The Soma when bought and tied up indeed approaches the sacrificer in the shape of Varuna [5]. &lsquo;Honour to the radiance of Mitra and Varuna&rsquo;, he says, for atonement. They bring forward this Soma, it rests with Agni, they in uniting overpower the sacrificer. Now the consecrated person has for long been holding himself ready for the sacrifice. In that he offers an animal to Agni and Soma, that is a buying-off of himself; therefore of it he should not eat; for as it were it is a buying-off of a man. Or rather they say, &lsquo;By Agni and Soma Indra slew Vrtra&rsquo;. In that he offers an animal to Agni and Soma, it slays hostile things for him; therefore he should eat of it. He honours it with a verse addressed to Varuna; verily he honours it with its own deity.</p>

<h4 id="01-32">01</h4>
<p>If he should offer hospitality after unyoking both (the oxen), he would break up the sacrifice. If (he should offer) before he has unyoked both, it would be as when hospitality is offered to one who has</p>
<p>not yet arrived. One ox is unyoked, one ox is not unyoked; then he offers hospitality, for the continuance of the sacrifice. The wife (of the sacrificer) holds on (to the cart); for the wife is mistress of the household gear; verily he offers what is approved by the wife. The share of the wife in the sacrifice makes a pair; so the wife also [1] grasps the sacrifice that it may not be interrupted. With whatever retinue the king comes, to all of them hospitality is offered; the metres are the retinue of King Soma. &lsquo;Thou art the hospitality of Agni. For Visnu thee!&rsquo; he says; thus he offers (hospitality) to the Gayatri. &lsquo;Thou art the hospitality of Soma. &lsquo;For Visnu thee!&rsquo; he says; thus he offers (hospitality) to the Tristubh. &lsquo;Thou art the hospitality of the stranger. For Visnu thee!&rsquo; he says; thus he offers (hospitality) to the Jagati [2]. &lsquo;For Agni thee, giver of wealth, for Visnu thee!&rsquo; he says; thus he offers (hospitality) to the Anustubh. &lsquo;For the eagle, bringer of the Soma, thee, for Visnu thee!&rsquo; he says; thus he offers (hospitality) to the Gayatri. He offers five times. The Pankti has five syllables, the sacrifice is fivefold; verily he wins the sacrifice. The theologians say, &lsquo;For what reason is the Gayatri offered to on either side of the offering of hospitality?&rsquo; Because the Gayatri brought the Soma down [3]; therefore is it offered to on both sides of hospitality, before and after. Hospitality is the head of the sacrifice, the sacrificial cake is offered on nine potsherds, therefore the head has nine apertures. The sacrificial cake is offered on nine potsherds. The three sets of three potsherds are commensurate with the Trivrt Stoma, the Trivrt is brilliance; verily he places brilliance in the head of the sacrifice. The sacrificial cake is offered on nine potsherds. The three sets of three potsherds are commensurate with the threefold breath, the breath is threefold [4]; verily in order he places the threefold breath in the head of the sacrifice. Now the Saccharum spontaneum shoots are the eyelashes of Prajapati, and his lids are pieces of sugar-cane. In that the strew is of Saccharum spontaneum and the dividing-stakes of sugar-cane, verily he brings together the eye of Prajapati. Now the libations made by the gods the Asuras tore and ate. The gods saw the Gmelina arborea tree. (Thinking) &lsquo;It is fit for work; by it one can perform work&rsquo;, they made the enclosing sticks of Gmelina arborea wood [5], and by them they smote away the Raksases. In that the enclosing-sticks are made of Gmelina arborea wood, it is for the smiting away of the Raksases. He makes them touch, that the Raksases may not go through them. He does not place one in front, for the sun which rises in front smites away the Raksases. He places the kindling-sticks erect; verily from above he smites away the Raksases; (he places one) with a Yajus, the other in silence, to make a pair. He places two; the sacrifice has two feet; (verily they serve) for support. The theologians say [6], &lsquo;There are both Agni and Soma here; why is hospitality offered to Soma and not to Agni?&rsquo; In that having kindled fire he places it on the fire, by that verily is hospitality offered to Agni. Or rather they say, &lsquo;Agni is all the gods.&rsquo; In that he kindles fire after placing the oblation, he thus produces all the gods for the oblation when it has been placed.</p>
<h4 id="02-32">02</h4>
<p>The gods and the Asuras were in conflict. The gods fell out among themselves. Being unwilling to accept one another&rsquo;s pre-eminence, they separated in five bodies, Agni with the Vasus, Soma with the Rudras, Indra with the Maruts, Varuna with the Adityas, Brhaspati with the All-gods. They reflected, &lsquo;Our foes, the Asuras, we are profiting in that we are falling out among ourselves; let us remove (from us) and deposit together those bodies which are dear to us; from these shall he depart who [1] first of us is hostile to another.&rsquo; Therefore of those who perform the Tanunaptra rite he who first is hostile goes to destruction. In that he divides up the Tanunaptra, (it serves) for the overcoming of the foe; he himself prospers, his foe is defeated. He divides five times; for five times did they divide. Then again the Pankti has five syllables, the sacrifice is fivefold; verily he wins the sacrifice. &lsquo;For him who rusheth on I seize thee&rsquo;, he says; he who rushes on is the breath [2]; verily he delights the breath. &lsquo;For him who rusheth around&rsquo;, he says; he who rushes around is the mind; verily he delights the mind. &lsquo;For Tanunaptra&rsquo;, he says; for they divided up these bodies. &lsquo;For the mighty&rsquo;, he says; for they divided them up for strength. &lsquo;For the greatest in strength&rsquo;, he says; for they divided up the greatest part of themselves. &lsquo;Thou art unsurmounted, the unsurmountable&rsquo;, he says; for that is unsurmounted and unsurmountable. &lsquo;The force of the gods&rsquo; [3], be says; for that is the force of the gods. &lsquo;Guarding from imprecations, impervious to imprecations&rsquo;, he says; for that guards from imprecations and is impervious to imprecations. &lsquo;May the lord of consecration approve my consecration&rsquo;, he says; that is according to the text. The gods making the ghee a weapon smote</p>
<p>Soma; now they come near the Soma as it were, when they perform the Tanunaptra. &lsquo;May thy every shoot, O god Soma, swell&rsquo;, be says. Whatever [4] of it becomes spoiled&rsquo; or is lost, that he purifies by it. &lsquo;May Indra swell for thee; do thou swell for Indra&rsquo;, he says; verily he makes to swell both Indra and Soma. &lsquo;Make thy comrades to .swell with wealth and skill&rsquo;, he says. The priests are his comrades; verily he makes them to swell. &lsquo;With good fortune may I accomplish thy pressing, O god Soma&rsquo; [5], he says; verily he invokes this blessing (on himself). Those who make the Soma to swell fall away from this world, for the Soma when made to swell has the atmosphere as its deity. &lsquo;Desired are riches exceedingly, for food, for prosperity&rsquo;, he says; verily by paying homage to heaven and earth they find support in this world. The gods and the Asuras were in conflict. The gods in fear entered Agni; therefore they say, &lsquo;Agni is all the gods&rsquo;. They [6], making Agni their protection, overcame the Asuras. Now he as it were enters Agni who undergoes the intermediate consecration, (and it serves) for the overcoming of his foes; he prospers himself, his foe is overcome. He protects himself by the consecration, his offspring by the intermediate consecration. The girdle he makes tighter; for his offspring are closer to him than himself. He drinks warm milk, and rubs himself with bubbling water; for fire is extinguished by cold, (and these serve) for kindling. &lsquo;Thy dread form, O Agni&rsquo;, he says; verily with its own deity he consumes the hot milk, for unity, for atonement.</p>
<h4 id="03-33">03</h4>
<p>The Asuras had three citadels; the lowest was of iron, then there was one of silver, then one of gold. The gods could not conquer them; they sought to conquer them by siege; therefore they say&ndash;both those who know thus and those who do not&ndash;&lsquo;By siege they conquer great citadels.&rsquo; They made ready an arrow, Agni as the point, Soma as the socket, Visnu as the shaft. They said, &lsquo;Who shall shoot it?&rsquo; [1] &lsquo;Rudra&rsquo;, they said, &lsquo;Rudra is cruel, let him shoot it.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;Let me choose a boon; let me be overlord of animals.&rsquo; Therefore is Rudra overlord of animals. Rudra let it go; it cleft the three citadels and drove the Asuras away from these worlds. The observance of the Upasads is for the driving away of foes. One should not offer another libation in front; if be were to offer another libation in front [2], he would make something else the beginning. He sprinkles clarified butter with the dipping-ladle to proclaim the sacrifice. He makes the offering after crossing over without coming back; verily he drives away his foes from these worlds so that they come not back. Then returning he offers the Upasad libation; verily having driven away his foes from these worlds and having conquered he mounts upon the world of his foes. Now the gods by the Upasads which they performed in the morning drove away the Asuras from the day, by the Upasads (performed) in the evening (they drove away the Asuras) from the night. In that both morning and evening Upasads [3] are performed, the sacrificer drives away his foes from day and night. The Yajyas used in the morning should be made Puronuvakyas at night, for variety. He performs three Upasads, these worlds are three; verily he delights these worlds; they together make six, the seasons are six; verily he delights the seasons. He performs twelve at an Ahina Soma sacrifice, the year consists of twelve months; verily he de lights the year. They make twenty-four [4], the half-months number twenty four; verily he delights the half-months. He should perform an awl-shaped intermediate consecration who wishes, &lsquo;May there be prosperity for me in this world&rsquo;, (that is) one to begin with, then two, then three, then four; this indeed is the awl-shaped intermediate consecration; verily there is prosperity for him in this world. He should perform an intermediate consecration broader at the top than below who wishes, &lsquo;May there be prosperity for me in yonder world&rsquo;, (that is) four to begin with, then three, then two, then one; this indeed is the intermediate consecration broader at the top than below; verily there is prosperity for him in yonder world.</p>
<h4 id="04-34">04</h4>
<p>They go to the world of heaven who perform the Upasads. Of them he who takes out (a little food) is left behind; one must take out carefully, (thinking) &lsquo;I have not taken out anything.&rsquo; He who is left behind wearied among those who go on their own mission sticks behind and lives at (home). Therefore after once taking out, one should not take out a second time. One should take out of curd, that is the symbol of cattle; verily by the symbol he wins cattle [1]. The sacrifice went away from</p>
<p>the gods in the form of Visnu, and entered the earth. The gods sought him grasping hands. Indra passed over him. He said, &lsquo;Who has passed over me?&rsquo; &lsquo;I am he who smites in the stronghold; who art thou?&rsquo; &lsquo;I am he who brings from the stronghold.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;Thou art called he who smites in the stronghold. Now a boar, stealer of the good, [2] keeps the wealth of the Asuras which is to be won beyond the seven hills. Him smite, if thou art he who smites in the stronghold.&rsquo; He plucked out a bunch of Darbha grass, pierced the seven hills, and smote him. He said, &lsquo;Thou art called he who brings from the stronghold; bring him.&rsquo; So the sacrifice bore off the sacrifice for them; in that they won the wealth of the Asuras which was to be won (védyam), that alone is the reason why the Vedi is so called. The Asuras [3] indeed at first owned the earth, the gods had so much as one seated can espy. The gods said, &lsquo;May we also have a share in the earth?&rsquo; &lsquo;How much shall we give you?&rsquo; &lsquo;Give us as much as this Salavrki can thrice run round.&rsquo; Indra taking the form of a Salavrki thrice ran round on all sides the earth. So they won the earth, and in that they won it therefore is the Vedi so called [4]. All this earth is the Vedi, but they measure off and sacrifice on so much as they deem they can use. The back cross-line is thirty feet, the eastern line is thirty-six feet, the front cross-line is twenty-four feet. These make up tens; the Viraj has ten syllables; the Viraj is food; verily by the Viraj he wins food. He digs up (the earth); verily he digs away whatever in it is impure. He digs up; therefore the plants perish. He spreads the sacrificial strew; therefore the plants again revive. He spreads over the strew the upper strew. The strew is the people; the upper strew is the sacrificer; verily he makes the sacrificer higher than the man who does not sacrifice; therefore the sacrificer is higher than the man who does not sacrifice.</p>
<h4 id="05-34">05</h4>
<p>If a weak man take up a burden, he breaks up into pieces. If there were twelve Upasads in the one day rite, and three in the Ahina, the sacrifice would be upset. There are three Upasads in the one day rite, twelve in the Ahina, to preserve the strength of the sacrifice; thus it is in order. One teat (of the cow) is used for a child, for that is fortunate. So he takes one teat for his milk drink, then two, then three, then four. That [1] is the razor-edged drink by which he drives away his foes when born and repels them when about to be born; verily also with the smaller he approaches the greater. He takes the four teats first for his drink, then three, then two, then one. That is the drink called &lsquo;of a beatific back&rsquo;, full of fervour, and of heavenly character; verily also is he propagated with children and cattle. Gruel is the drink of the Rajanya; gruel is as it were harsh; the Rajanya is as it were harsh [2], it is the symbol of the thunderbolt, (and serves) for success. Curds (is the drink) of the Vaiśya, it is the symbol of the sacrifice of cooked food, (and serves) for prosperity. Milk (is the drink) of the Brahman, the Brahman is brilliance, milk is brilliance; verily by brilliance he endows himself with brilliance and milk. Again by milk foetuses grow; the man who is consecrated is as it were a foetus; in that milk is his drink, verily thus he causes himself to grow. Manu was wont thrice to take drink, the Asuras twice, the gods once [3]. Morning, midday, evening, were the times of Manu&rsquo;s drinking, the symbol of the sacrifice of cooked food, (serving) for prosperity. Morning and evening were those of the Asuras, without a middle, a symbol of hunger; thence were they overcome. Midday and midnight were those of the gods; thence they prospered and went to the world of heaven. Now with regard to his drinking at midday and at midnight, it is in the middle that people feed themselves; verily he places strength in the middle of himself, for the overcoming of his foes. He prospers himself [4], his foe is overcome. Now the man who is consecrated is a foetus, the consecration-shed is the womb (in which he is). If the man who is consecrated were to leave the consecration-shed, it would be as when a foetus falls from the womb. He must not leave, to guard himself. The fire here is a tiger to guard the house. Therefore if the man who is consecrated were to leave (the shed), he would be likely to spring up and slay him. He must not leave, to protect himself. He lies on the right side; that is the abode of the sacrifice; verily he lies in his own abode. He lies turned towards the fire; verily he lies turned towards the gods and the sacrifice.</p>
<h4 id="06-34">06</h4>
<p>On a place of sacrifice where the sacrifice faces the east should he make him to sacrifice for whom he wishes, &lsquo;May the higher sacrifice condescend to him, may he gain the world of heaven.&rsquo; That is</p>
<p>the place of sacrifice where the sacrifice faces the east, where the Hotr as be recites the Prataranuvaka gazes upon the fire, water, and the sun. To him the higher sacrifice condescends, he gains the world of heaven. On a contiguous (aptá) place of sacrifice should he make him to sacrifice who has foes. He should make it touch the road or a pit so that neither a wagon nor a chariot can go between [1]. That is a contiguous place of sacrifice. He conquers (apnoti) his foe, his foe conquers him not. On a place of sacrifice which is elevated in one place he should make him to sacrifice who desires cattle. The Angirases produced cattle from a place of sacrifice elevated in one place. It should be elevated between the seat and the oblation-holders. That is a place of sacrifice elevated in one place; verily he becomes possessed of cattle. On a place of sacrifice which is elevated in three places should he make him to sacrifice who desires heaven. The Angirases went to the world of heaven from a place of sacrifice elevated in three places. It should be elevated between the Ahavaniya fire and the oblation holder [2], between the oblation-holder and the seat, and between the seat and the Garhapatya fire. That is a place of sacrifice elevated in three places; verily he goes to the world of heaven. On a place of sacrifice which is firm should he make him to sacrifice who desires support. That is a place of sacrifice which is firm, which is level on all sides; verily he finds, support. Where diverse plants are intertwined, there should he make him sacrifice who desires cattle. That is the form of cattle; verily by the form he wins cattle for him [3]; verily be becomes possessed of cattle. On a place of sacrifice seized by destruction should he make him to sacrifice for whom he desires, &lsquo;May I cause his sacrifice to be seized by destruction.&rsquo; That is a place of sacrifice seized by destruction where there is a bare patch of level ground; verily he causes his sacrifice to be seized by destruction. On a place of sacrifice which is distinctly marked should he cause him to sacrifice regarding whom they have doubts as to (admitting him to) common meals or to marriage. It should be sloping east of the Ahavaniya and west of the Garhapatya. That is a place of sacrifice which is distinctly marked, be is distinguished from his evil foe, they doubt not of him for common meal or wedding. On a place of sacrifice which is artificial should he make him sacrifice who desires wealth. Man must be made; verily he prospers.</p>

<p>The high altar taking the form of a lioness went away and remained between the two parties. The gods reflected, &lsquo;Whichever of the two she joins, they will become this.&rsquo; They called to her; she said, &lsquo;Let me choose a boon; through me shall ye obtain all your desires, but the oblation shall come to me before (it comes to) the fire.&rsquo; Therefore do they besprinkle the high altar before (they sprinkle) the fire, for that was its chosen boon. He measures (it) round with the yoke-pin [1], that is its measure; verily also by what is fitting he wins what is fitting. &lsquo;Thou art the abode of riches (vitta) for me&rsquo;, he says, for being found (vitta) she helped them; thou art the resort of the afflicted for me&rsquo;, he says, for she helped them in affliction; &lsquo;protect me when in want&rsquo;, he says, for she protected them when in want; &lsquo;protect me when afflicted&rsquo;, he says, for she protected them when afflicted. &lsquo;May Agni, named Nabhas, know (thee) [2], O Agni Angiras&rsquo;, (with these words) he thrice strokes with (the wooden sword); verily he wins the fires that are in these worlds. He strokes in silence for the fourth time, verily he wins that which is not indicated. &lsquo;Thou art a lioness; thou art a buffalo&rsquo;, he says, for it (the high altar) taking the form of a lioness went away and remained between the two parties. &lsquo;Extend wide; let the lord of the sacrifice extend wide for thee&rsquo;, he says; verily he enriches the sacrificer with offspring and cattle. &lsquo;Thou art firm&rsquo; [3], (with these words) he strikes (the earth) together, for firmness. &lsquo;Be pure for the gods; be bright for the gods&rsquo;, (with these words) he moistens it and scatters (sand) on it, for purity. &lsquo;May the cry of Indra guard thee in front with the Vasus&rsquo;, be says; verily be sprinkles it from the quarters. &lsquo;Since the high altar has gone to the gods, here must we conquer&rsquo; (thought) the Asuras, and with bolts ready they advanced on the gods. Them the cry of Indra with the Vasus repelled in front [4]; the swift of mind with the Pitrs on the right, the wise one with the Rudras behind, and Viśvakarman with the Adityas on the left. In that he sprinkles the high altar, verily thus does the sacrificer repel his foes from the quarters. Indra gave the Yatis to the Salavrkas; them they ate on the right of the high altar. Whatever is left of the sprinkling waters he should pour on the right of the high altar; whatever cruel is there that he appeases thereby. He should think of whomever he hates; verily he brings affliction upon him.</p>

<p>The high altar said, &lsquo;Through me ye shall obtain all your desires.&rsquo; The gods desired, &lsquo;Let us overcome the Asuras our foes.&rsquo; They sacrificed (with the words),&lsquo;Thou art a lioness, overcoming rivals; hail!&rsquo; They over came the Asuras, their foes. Having overcome the Asuras, their foes, they felt desire, &lsquo;May we obtain offspring.&rsquo; They sacrificed (with the words), &lsquo;Thou art a lioness, bestowing fair offspring, hail!&rsquo; They obtained offspring. They having obtained offspring [1] felt desire, &lsquo;May we obtain cattle.&rsquo; They sacrificed (with the words), &lsquo;Thou art a lioness, bestowing increase of wealth; hail!&rsquo; They obtained cattle. Having obtained cattle, they felt desire, &lsquo;May we obtain support.&rsquo; They sacrificed (with the words), &lsquo;Thou art a lioness, winning (the favour of) the Adityas; hail!&rsquo; They found support here. Having found support here, they felt desire, &lsquo;May we approach the deities for blessings.&rsquo; They sacrificed (with the words), &lsquo;Thou art a lioness; bring the gods to the pious [2] sacrificer; hail!&rsquo; They approached the deities for blessings. He sprinkles five times; the Pankti has five syllables, the sacrifice is fivefold; verily he wins the sacrifice. He sprinkles transversely; therefore cattle move their limbs transversely, for support. &lsquo;For beings thee!&rsquo; (with these words) he takes up the ladle; of the gods that are that is the share; verily he therewith delights them. He puts round the enclosing-sticks of Butea frondosa, for the holding apart of these worlds [3]. Agni had three elder brothers. They perished when carrying the offering to the gods. Agni was afraid, &lsquo;This one here will come to ruin.&rsquo; He went away. The (night) he spent among the trees was with the Butea frondosa: the (night) among the plants was with the Sugandhitejana; the (night) among the cattle was between the horns of a ram. The gods sought to start him forth. They found him, and said to him [4],&rsquo; Return to us; bear the offering for us.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;Let me choose a boon. Whatever of the offering when taken up falls outside the enclosing sticks, let that be the portion of my brothers.&rsquo; Therefore whatever of the offering when taken up falls outside the enclosing-sticks, that is their portion; verily therewith be delights them. He reflected, &lsquo;My brothers of old perished because they had bones. I will shatter bones.&rsquo; The bones he shattered became the Buteafrondosa, the flesh which died on them bdellium. In that he brings together these paraphernalia, verily thus be brings Agni together. &lsquo;Thou art the rubble of Agni&rsquo;, he says, for the paraphernalia are the rubble of Agni. Or rather they say, &lsquo;These enclosing-sticks of Buteafrondosa which lie around are in truth his brothers.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He loosens the knot; verily he sets them free from the noose of Varuna; verily he makes them fit for the sacrifice. Having sacrificed with a verse to Savitr, he brings forward the oblation-holders; verily on the instigation of Savitr he brings them forward. The axle which is tied on both sides is Varuna of evil speech; if it were to creak, it would creak against the house of the sacrificer. &lsquo;With fair voice, O god, do thou address the dwelling&rsquo;, he says; the dwelling is the house; (verily it serves) for atonement. The wife (of the sacrificer) [1] anoints (them), for the wife is every one&rsquo;s friend, for friendship. The share of the wife in the sacrifice makes a pair; verily also the wife grasps the sacrifice that it may not be interrupted. Now the Raksases following in its track seek to injure the sacrifice; he makes a libation in the two tracks with Rc verses addressed to Visnu. The sacrifice is Visnu; verily he drives away the Raksases from the sacrifice. If the Adhvaryu were to pour the libation in (a place) without fire, the Adhvaryu would become blind, the Raksases would injure the sacrifice [2]. He puts gold down on it before making the libation; verily he makes the libation in that which has fire; the Adhvaryu does not become blind, the Raksases do not injure the sacrifice. &lsquo;Come ye two forward, ordaining the offering&rsquo;, he says; verily he makes them go to the world of heaven. &lsquo;There rejoice on the height of the earth &lsquo;, he says, for the place of sacrifice is the height of the earth. Now the oblation-holder is the head of the sacrifice. &lsquo;From the sky, O Visnu, or from the earth&rsquo; [3], with this Rc verse which contains a blessing he strikes in the prop of the southern oblation-holder; verily the sacrificer at the beginning of the sacrifice wins blessings. Now Danda Aupara split by the Vasat call the axle of the third oblation-holder; the third cover put on the oblation-holder (serves) to make up the third oblation-holder, The oblation-holder is the head of the sacrifice. &lsquo;Thou art the forehead of Visnu: thou art the back of Visnu&rsquo;, he says. Therefore so often is the head divided. &lsquo;Thou art the string of Visnu; thou art the fixed point of Visnu&rsquo;, he says, for the</p>
<p>oblation-holder is connected with Visnu as its deity. Now the knot which he first ties, if he were not to unloose it, the Adhvaryu would perish from suppression of urine; therefore it must be unloosed.</p>

<p>&lsquo;On the impulse of the god Savitr&rsquo;, (with these words) he takes up the spade, for impelling. &lsquo;With the arms of the Aśvins he says, for the Aśvins were the priests of the gods. &lsquo;With the hands of Pusan&rsquo;, be for restraint. Now the spade is as it were a bolt; &lsquo;Thou art the spade; thou art the, woman&rsquo;, he says, to appease it. Now, as each part is performed, the Raksases seek to injure the sacrifice; &lsquo;The Raksas is encompassed, the evil spirits are encompassed&rsquo;, he says, to smite away the Raksases [1]. &lsquo;Here do I cut off the neck of the Raksas, who hateth us, and whom we hate&rsquo;, he says; there are two people, he whom he hates and he who hates him; verily straightway he cuts their necks. &lsquo;To sky thee, to atmosphere thee, to earth thee!&rsquo; he says; verily he anoints it for these worlds. He anoints from the top downwards; therefore [2] men live on strength from the top downwards. Now he does a cruel deed in that he digs; he pours down water, for atonement. He pours down (water) mixed with barley; barley is strength, the Udumbara is strength; verily he unites strength with strength. (The post) is of Udumbara wood of the height of the sacrificer. As great as is the sacrificer, so much strength does he put in it. &lsquo;Thou art the seat of the Pitrs&rsquo;, (with these words) he spreads the strew, for what is dug in has the Pitrs for its deity [3]. If he were to set it up without strewing, it would be dug in and have the Pitrs for its deity; he sets it up after strewing; verily he sets it up in this (earth), and makes it firm-rooted.&rsquo; &lsquo;Support the sky, fill the atmosphere&rsquo;, he says, for the distinction of these worlds. &lsquo;May Dyutana Maruta set thee up&rsquo;, he says; Dyutana Maruta was wont to set up the Udumbara (post) of the gods; verily [4] by him he sets this (post) up. &lsquo;Thee that art winner of Brahmans, winner of nobles&rsquo;, he says; that is according to the text. &lsquo;With ghee, O sky and earth, be filled&rsquo;, (with these words) he sacrifices on the Udumbara (post); verily with moisture he anoints sky and earth. He makes it run right to the end; verily completely does he anoint the sacrificer with brilliance. &lsquo;Thou art of Indra&rsquo;, (with these words) he puts down the covering, for the seat has Indra as its deity. &lsquo;The shade of all folk&rsquo;, he says, for the seat is the shade of all folk. (A roof of) nine coverings [5] should he fix for one who desires brilliance, commensurate with the Trivrt Stoma; the Trivrt is brilliance; verily he becomes brilliant; one of eleven coverings (he should fix) for one who desires power; the Tristubh has eleven syllables, the Tristubh is power; verily he becomes powerful. (A roof of) fifteen coverings (he should fix) for one who has foes; the thunderbolt is fifteenfold; (verily it serves) for the overcoming of foes. (A roof of) seventeen coverings (he should fix) for one who desires offspring- Prajapati is sixteenfold. (verily it serves) to gain Prajapati. (A roof of) twenty-one coverings (he should fix) for one who desires support; the Ekavinśa is the support of the Stomas; (verily it serves) for support. The Sadas is the stomach, the Udumbara is strength, in the middle he fixes (the post) of Udumbara wood; verily he places strength in the midst of offspring; therefore [6] in the middle they enjoy strength. In the world of the sacrificer are the southern coverings, in that of his foe are the northern; he makes the southern the higher; verily he makes the sacrificer higher than the man who does not sacrifice; therefore the sacrificer is higher than the man who does not sacrifice. He fills up the crevices, for distinction; therefore people depend on the forest. &lsquo;May our songs, O lover of song&rsquo;, he says; that is according to the text. &lsquo;Thou art the string of Indra;. thou art the fixed point of Indra&rsquo;, he says; for the Sadas has Indra for its deity. Now the knot which he first ties, if he were not to unloose it, the Adhvaryu would perish through suppression of urine; therefore it must be unloosed.</p>

<p>The oblation-holder is the head of the sacrifice, the sounding holes are the vital airs. They are dug in the oblation-holder; therefore. the vital airs are in the head. They are dug below; therefore the vital airs are below the head. &lsquo;I dig those which slay the Raksas, which slay the spell, and which are of Visnu&rsquo;, he says, for the sounding-holes have Visnu for their deity. The Asuras in retreat dug in spells against the vital airs of the gods; they found them at the distance of an arm; therefore they are dug an arm&rsquo;s length deep. &lsquo;Here do I cast out the spell [1] which an equal or an unequal hath buried&rsquo;, he says; there are two sorts of men, the equal and the unequal; verily whatever spell they dig against</p>
<p>him he thus casts out. He unites them; therefore the vital airs are united within. He does not combine them; therefore the vital airs are not combined. He pours water over; therefore the vital airs are moist within. (The water) he pours is mixed with barley [2]; barley is strength, the sounding-holes are the vital airs; verily he places strength in the vital airs. He spreads over the strew; therefore the vital airs are hairy within. He besprinkles (the holes) with butter; butter is brilliance, the sounding-holes are the vital airs; verily he places brilliance in the vital airs. The pressing-boards are the jaws of the sacrifice; he does not join them, for the jaws are not joined; or rather at a long Soma sacrifice they should be joined, for firmness. The oblation-holder is the head of the sacrifice [3], the sounding-holes are the vital airs, the pressing-boards the jaws, the skin the tongue, the pressing-stones the teeth the Ahavaniya the mouth, the high altar the nose, the Sadas the stomach. When he eats with his tongue on his teeth, (the food) goes to the mouth; when it goes to the mouth, then it goes to the stomach, therefore they press (the juice) with the pressing-stones on the oblation-holder over the skin, sacrifice in the Ahavaniya, retire towards the west, and consume (the Soma) in the Sadas. He who knows the milking of the Viraj in the mouth of the sacrifice milks her; the Viraj is this (cow), the skin is its hide, the pressing-boards its udder, the sounding-holes its teats, the pressing-stones its calves, the priests the milkers, Soma the milk. He, who knows thus, milks her.</p>

<p>From the pit he scatters (earth) on the altars; the pit is the birthplace of the sacrifice; (verily it serves) to unite the sacrifice with its birthplace. The gods lost by conquest the sacrifice; they won it again from the Agnidh&rsquo;s altar; the Agnidh&rsquo;s altar is the invincible part of the sacrifice. In that he draws off the altar fires from that of the Agnidh, he renews the sacrifice from the invincible part of it. Conquered as it were they go who creep to the Bahispavamana (Stotra) when the Bahispavamana has been sung [1], he says, &lsquo;Agnidh, draw off the fires, spread the strew, make ready the sacrificial cake.&rsquo; Verily having re-won the sacrifice they keep renewing it. At two pressings he draws off by means of embers, at the third with (flaming) splinters, to give it glory verily he completes it. The altars guarded the Soma in yonder world they took away the Soma from them; they followed it and surrounded it. He who knows thus [2] wins an attendant. They were deprived of the Soma drink; they besought the gods for the Soma drink; the gods said to them, &lsquo;Take two names each; then shall ye gain it, or not.&rsquo; Then the altars became fires (also); therefore a Brahman who has two names is likely to prosper. Those which came nearest gained the Soma drink viz. the Ahavaniya, the Agnidh&rsquo;s altar, the Hotr&rsquo;s, and the Marjaliya; therefore they sacrifice on them. He leaves them out in uttering the cry for sacrifice, for [3] they were deprived of the Soma drink. The gods drove away the Asuras who were in front by the sacrifices which they offered on the eastern side, and the Asuras who were behind by those which they offered on the western side. Soma libations are offered in the east, seated to the west he besprinkles the altars; verily from behind and from in front the sacrificer smites away his enemies; therefore offspring are engendered behind, and are brought forth in front [4]. The altars are the breaths; if the Adhvaryu were to go past the altars to the west, he would mingle the breaths, he would be liable to die. The Hotr is the navel of the sacrifice; the expiration is above the navel, the inspiration is below; if the Adhvaryu were to go past the Hotr to the west, he would place the expiration in the inspiration, he would be liable to die. The Adhvaryu should not accompany the song; the Adhvaryu&rsquo;s strength is his voice; if the Adhvaryu were to accompany the song, he would confer his voice on the Udgatr [5], and his voice would fail. The theologians say, &lsquo;The Adhvaryu should not go beyond the Sadas to the west before the Soma offering is completed. Then how is he to go to offer the sacrifices in the southern fire? Because that is the end of the fires. But how are the gods to know whether it is the end or not?&rsquo; He goes round the Agnidh&rsquo;s altar to the north and offers the sacrifices in the southern fire; verily he does not mingle the breaths. Some of the altars are besprinkled, some not; those which he besprinkles he delights; those which he does not besprinkle he delights by indicating them.</p>

<p>The Vaisarjana offerings are made for the world of heaven. He offers in the Garhapatya with two verses; the sacrificer has two feet; (verily it serves) for support. He offers in the Agnidh&rsquo;s fire; verily he approaches the atmosphere; he offers in the Ahavaniya; verily he makes him go to the world of heaven. The Raksases sought to harm the gods as they were going to the world of heaven; they smote away the Raksases through Soma, the king, and making themselves active went to the world of heaven, to prevent the Raksases seizing them. The Soma is ready at hand; so he offers [1] the Vaisarjanas, to smite away the Raksases. &lsquo;Thou, O Soma, brought about by ourselves&rsquo;, he says, for he is the one who brings about by himself; &lsquo;from hostility brought about by others&rsquo;, he says, for the Raksases are brought about by others; &lsquo;thou art the giver of wide protection&rsquo;, he says; in effect he says, &lsquo;give us wide (protection).&rsquo; &lsquo;May the active one gladly partake of the ghee&rsquo;, he says; verily he makes the sacrificer active and causes him to go to the world of heaven, to prevent the Raksases seizing him. They take up the Soma [2], the pressing-stones, the cups for Vayu, the wooden trough; they lead forth the wife (of the sacrificer), they make the carts move along with them; verily whatever is his he goes with it to the world of heaven. He offers in the Agnidh&rsquo;s fire with a verse containing the word &lsquo;lead&rsquo;, for leading to the world of heaven. He places on the Agnidh&rsquo;s altar the pressing-stones, the cups for Vayu, and the wooden trough, for they take it away from them; if he were to put it with them, it would become spoiled. He makes it go forward with a verse addressed to Soma; verily by means of its own [3] divinity he makes it go forward. &lsquo;Thou art the seat of Aditi; do thou sit on the seat of Aditi&rsquo;, he says; that is according to the text. Hitherto the sacrificer has guarded the Soma. &lsquo;This, O god Savitr, is the Soma of you (gods)&rsquo;, he says; verily instigated by Savitr, he hands it over to the gods. &lsquo;Thou, O Soma, god to the gods, hast thou gone&rsquo;, he says, for it being a god [4] goes to the gods. &lsquo;I here, man to men&rsquo;, he says, for he being a man goes to men. If he were not to say that formula, the sacrificer would be without offspring or cattle. &lsquo;With offspring, with increase of wealth&rsquo;, he says; verily he abides in this world with offspring and with cattle. &lsquo;Homage to the gods&rsquo;, he says, for homage is the due of the gods; &lsquo;svadhá&rsquo; to the Pitrs&rsquo;, be says, for the svadhá call is the due of the Pitrs [5]. &lsquo;Here (may) I (be free) from Varuna&rsquo;s noose&rsquo;, he says; verily he is freed from Varuna&rsquo;s noose. &lsquo;O Agni, lord of vows,&rsquo; (he says). &lsquo;One should recover one&rsquo;s former body&rsquo;, they say, &lsquo;for who knows if the richer, when his will is accomplished will restore it or not.&rsquo; The pressing-stones are the troop of thieves of King Soma; him, who knowing thus, places the pressing-stones on the Agnidh&rsquo;s altar, the troop of thieves finds not.</p>

<p>Having sacrificed with a verse addressed to Visnu, he approaches the post. The post has Visnu for its deity; verily he approaches it with its own deity. &lsquo;I have passed by others, I have not approached others&rsquo;, he says, for he passes by others, and does not approach others. I have found thee nearer than the farther, farther than the near&rsquo;, he says, for he finds it nearer than the farther, farther than the near. &lsquo;I welcome thee that art of Visnu, for the sacrifice to the gods&rsquo; [1], he says, for he welcomes it for the sacrifice to the gods. &lsquo;Let the god Savitr anoint thee with honey&rsquo;, he says; verily he anoints it with glory. &lsquo;O plant, guard it; O axe, harm it not&rsquo;, he says; the axe is the thunderbolt; (verily it serves) for atonement. The brilliance of the tree which fears the axe falls away with the first chip; the first chip which falls he should take up; verily he takes it up with its brilliance [2]. These worlds are afraid of the falling forward of the tree. &lsquo;With thy top graze not the sky, with thy middle harm not the atmosphere&rsquo;, he says; verily he makes it tender for these worlds. &lsquo;O tree, grow with a hundred shoots&rsquo;, (with these words) he sacrifices on the stump; therefore many (shoots) spring up from the stump of trees. &lsquo;May we grow with a thousand shoots&rsquo;, he says; verily he invokes this blessing. He should cut it so that it will not touch the axle [3]. If he were to cut it so that it would touch the axle, the cattle of the sacrificer would be liable to perish. If he desire of any one, &lsquo;May he be without support&rsquo;, he should cut for him a branch; this among trees is not supported; verily he is without support. If he desire of any one, &lsquo;May he be without cattle&rsquo;, he should cut for him (a post) without leaves and with a withered top; this among trees is without cattle; verily he becomes without cattle. If he desire of any one, &lsquo;May he be rich in cattle&rsquo;, he should cut for him one with many leaves and many branches; this [4] among trees is rich in cattle; verily he becomes rich in</p>

<p>&lsquo;To earth thee! To atmosphere thee! To sky thee!&rsquo; he says; verily for these worlds he anoints it. He anoints from the foot upwards, for upwards as it were is the world of heaven. Cruel as it were is that which he does when he digs; he pours water over, for expiation he pours (water) mixed with barley; barley is strength. The post is of the height of the sacrificer. As great as is the sacrificer, so much strength does he put in it [1]. &lsquo;Thou art the seat of the Pitrs&rsquo;, (with these words) he spreads the strew, for what is dug in has the Pitrs for its deity.' If he were to set it up without strewing, it would be dug in and have the Pitrs for its deity; he sets it up after strewing; verily he sets it up in this (earth). He throws down the splinter of the post; verily he sets it up with its glory. &lsquo;Thee to the plants with fair berries&rsquo;, (with these words) he fixes on the top [2] therefore at the top plants bear fruit. He anoints it, butter is glory. The corner near the fire is of the same height as the sacrificer; in that he anoints the corner near the fire, he anoints with brilliance the sacrificer. He anoints it to the end; verily completely does he anoint the sacrificer with brilliance. He rubs it all around; verily he places brilliance in him completely. &lsquo;Support the sky, fill the atmosphere, with thy base make firm the earth&rsquo;, he says, for the separation of these worlds. With a verse addressed to Visnu [3] he arranges it; the post has Visnu for its deity; verily he arranges it with its own deity. He arranges it with two (verses); the sacrificer has two feet; (verily it serves) for support. If he desire of a man, &lsquo;May I deprive him of brilliance, of the deities, of power&rsquo;, he should move the corner near the fire to one side or the other of the Ahavaniya; verily he deprives him of brilliance, of the deities, of power. If he desire of a man, &lsquo;May I unite him with brilliance, with the deities, with power&rsquo; [4], he should set up for him the corner (of the post) near the fire in a line with the Ahavaniya; verily he unites him with brilliance, with the deities, with power. Thee that art winner of Brahmans, winner of nobles', he says that is according to the text. He winds round (the grass); the girdle is strength, the post is of the same height as the sacrificer; verily he unites the sacrificer with strength. He winds (it) round at the level of the navel; verily at the level of the navel he bestows upon him strength; therefore at the level of the navel men enjoy strength. If he desire of a man, &lsquo;May I deprive him of strength&rsquo; [5], he should put (it) on either upwards or downwards; verily he deprives him of strength. If he desire, &lsquo;May Parjanya rain&rsquo;, he should put it on downwards, verily he brings down rain; if he desire, &lsquo;May Parjanya not rain&rsquo;, he should put it on upwards; verily he holds up rain. What is dug in belongs to the Pitrs, what is above the part dug in up to the girdle belongs to men, the girdle belongs to the plants [6], what is above the girdle up to the top to the All-gods, the top to Indra, the rest to the Sadhyas. The post is connected with all the gods; verily in setting up the post he delights all the gods. By means of the sacrifice the gods went to the world of heaven; they reflected, &lsquo;Men will equal us&rsquo;; they blocked the way by the post and went to the world of heaven; the Rsis discerned that (world) by means of the post, and that is why it is called post [7]. In that be sets up the post, (it is) to discern the world of heaven. He puts (it) up to the east (of the fire), for before the sacrifice it is</p>
<p>proclaimed, for what is not proclaimed is that of which when it is passed men say, &lsquo;This should have been done.&rsquo; The Sadhya gods despised the sacrifice; the sacrifice touched them not; what was superabundant in the sacrifice touched them. The superabundant part of the sacrifice is the producing of fire and casting it on the fire; the superabundant part [8] of the post is the part above the top; that is their share; verily by it he delights them. The gods when the Soma sacrifice was complete cast the offering-spoons (into the fire) and the post; they reflected, &lsquo;Here we are making a disturbance of the sacrifice&rsquo;, they saw a ransom in the bunch of grass for the offering-spoons, in the chip for the post. When the Soma sacrifice is complete he casts (in the fire) the bunch of grass, he offers the chip, to avoid disturbing the sacrifice.</p>

<p>The Sadhya gods were in this world and nothing else living. They offered Agni as a sacrifice to Agni, for they found nothing else to offer; thence indeed these creatures were born; in that he casts the fire on the fire after producing it, (it serves for) the propagation of offspring. Now the fire is Rudra, the beast the sacrificer; if he were to produce the fire after offering the beast, he would place the sacrificer in the power of Rudra [1], and he would be liable to die. Or rather they say, &lsquo;All the gods are the fire, the beast the offering&rsquo;. In that he produces the fire after offering the beast, he brings forth all the gods for the offering which is made ready. The fire should be produced, after bringing up (the beast). The offering is then neither finished nor not begun. &lsquo;Thou art the birthplace of Agni&rsquo;, he says, for that is the birthplace of Agni. &lsquo;Ye are the two male ones&rsquo;, he says, for they are the two male ones [2]. &lsquo;Thou art Urvaśi, thou art Ayu&rsquo;, he says, to make a pair. &lsquo;Anointed with ghee do ye produce a male&rsquo;, he says, for they produce a male who (produce) Agni. &lsquo;Be born with the Gayatri metre&rsquo;, he says; verily he produces him with the metres. &lsquo;Recite for Agni as he is being produced&rsquo;, he says; he recites a verse to Savitr; verily, instigated by Savitr he produces him. &lsquo;Recite for him who is born&rsquo; [3], &lsquo;For him who is being cast forward recite&rsquo;, he says; verily as each part is performed he completes him. He recites all Gayatri verses; Agni has the Gayatri as his metre; verily he unites him with his own metre. The fire is in front; having produced fire he casts it forward; the two uniting overpower the sacrificer; &lsquo;Be of one mind with us&rsquo;, he says, to appease (them). He offers after casting (the fire) forward; verily he gives him food on birth; he offers with melted butter; the melted butter is the dear home of Agni; verily he unites him with his dear home, and also with brilliance.</p>

<p>&lsquo;For food thee!&rsquo; (with these words) he takes up the strew, for he who sacrifices strives (icháte) as it were. &lsquo;Thou art the impeller&rsquo;, he says, for he brings them up. &lsquo;To the gods the servants of the gods have come&rsquo;, he says, for being the servants of the gods they go to the gods. &lsquo;The priests, the eager ones&rsquo;, he says; the priests are the priests, the eager ones, therefore he says thus. &lsquo;O Brhaspati, guard wealth&rsquo; [1], he says; Brhaspati is the holy power (Brahman) of the gods; verily by the holy power he wins cattle for him. &lsquo;Let thy oblations taste sweet&rsquo;, be says; verily he makes them sweet. &lsquo;O god Tvastr, make pleasant our possessions&rsquo;, he says; Tvastr is the form-maker of the pairings of cattle; verily he places form in cattle. &lsquo;Stay, ye wealthy ones&rsquo;, he says; the wealthy ones are cattle; verily he makes cattle abide for him. &lsquo;On the impulse of god Savitr&rsquo; [2], (with these words) he takes up the rope, for instigation. &lsquo;With the arms of the Aśvins&rsquo;, he says, for the Aśvins were the Adhvaryus of the gods. &lsquo;With the hands of Pusan&rsquo;, he says, for restraining. &lsquo;O offering to the gods, I seize thee with the noose of sacred order&rsquo;, he says; sacred order is truth; verily with truth which is sacred order he seizes it. He winds (the rope) round transversely, for they fasten a (beast) for killing in front; (verily it serves) for distinction. &lsquo;Fear not men&rsquo;, (with these words) he fastens it, for security. &lsquo;For the waters [3] thee, for the plants thee I sprinkle&rsquo;, be says, for from the waters, from the plants, the beast is born. &lsquo;Thou art a drinker of the waters&rsquo;, he says, for he is a drinker of the waters who is offered in sacrifice. &lsquo;O ye divine waters, make it palatable, a very palatable offering for the gods&rsquo;, he says; verily he makes it palatable. From above he sprinkles (it); verily he makes it pure from above; he makes it drink; verily within he makes it pure; from below he besprinkles (it); verily all over he makes it pure.</p>
<h4 id="07-34">07</h4>
<p>By means of Agni as Hotr the gods defeated the Asuras. Recite for Agni as he is kindled', he says, for the overcoming of foes. He recites seventeen kindling-verses; Prajapati is seventeenfold; (verily it serves) to win Prajapati. He recites seventeen; there are twelve months and seven seasons, that is the year; offspring are born in the course of the year; (verily it serves) for the propagation of offspring. The gods, after reciting the kindling-verses, could not discern the sacrifice; Prajapati silently performed [1] the libation of ghee; then did the gods discern the sacrifice; in that silently he performs the libation of ghee, (it serves) for the revelation of the sacrifice. The sacrifice was with the Asuras; the gods took it by the silent offering; in that silently he performs the libation of ghee, he takes away the sacrifice of his foe. He rubs the enclosing-sticks; verily he purifies them. Thrice each he rubs them, for the sacrifice is thrice repeated; also (it serves) to smite away the Raksases. They make up twelve; the year has twelve [2] months; verily he delights the year, verily also he endows him with the year, for the gaining of the world of heaven. The libation of ghee is the head of the sacrifice, the fire is all the gods; in that he performs the libation of ghee, verily the sacrificer at the beginning of the sacrifice wins all the gods. The libation of ghee is the head of the sacrifice, the beast is the body; having performed the libation of ghee he anoints the beast; verily on the body of the sacrifice [3] he places the head. &lsquo;Let thy breath be united with the wind&rsquo;, he says; the breath has the wind for its deity; verily he offers its breath in the wind. &lsquo;Thy limbs with the sacrificers, the lord of the sacrifice with his prayer&rsquo;, he says; verily he causes the lord of the sacrifice to obtain its blessing. Viśvarupa, Tvastr&rsquo;s son, vomited over the beast from above; therefore they do not cut off (portions) from the beast above; in that he anoints the beast from above, verily he makes it pure [4]. He chooses the priests, verily he chooses the metres, he chooses seven; there are seven tame animals, seven wild; there are seven metres, (and so it serves) to win both. He offers eleven fore sacrifices; ten are the vital airs of the beast, the body is the eleventh; verily his fore-offerings are of the same size as the beast. One (of them) lies around the omentum; verily the body lies around the body. The axe is a thunderbolt, the splinter of the sacrificial post is a thunderbolt, the gods by making a thunderbolt of the ghee smote Soma. &lsquo;Anointed with ghee, do ye guard the beast&rsquo;, he says; verily, overpowering it by means of the thunderbolt, he offers it.</p>
<h4 id="08-33">08</h4>
<p>He encircles (it) with fire; verily he makes it completely offered, that nothing may be lost, for that which falls of the oblation is (thus) not lost. He encircles (it) with fire thrice, for the sacrifice is thrice repeated; also (it serves) to smite away the Raksases. The theologians say, &lsquo;Should the beast be grasped hold of, or not?&rsquo; Now the beast is led to death; if he were to grasp hold of it, the sacrificer would be likely to die. Or rather they say, &lsquo;The beast is led to the world of heaven&rsquo; [1]; if he were not to grasp hold of it, the sacrificer would be bereft of the world of heaven. He grasps hold (of it) by means of the omentum-forks; that is as it were neither grasped nor yet not grasped. &lsquo;Give directions, O Hotr, for making ready the oblations to the gods&rsquo;, he says, for an act that is directed is carried out. &lsquo;Ye wealthy ones, do ye kindly resort to the lord of the sacrifice&rsquo;, he says; that is according to the text. With the fire he goes in front, to smite away the Raksases. &lsquo;Guard from contact with earth&rsquo;, (with these words) he casts down the strew [2], that nothing may be lost, for that which falls on the strew is not lost; verily also he places it on the strew. The Adhvaryu turns away from the beast as it is slaughtered; verily he conceals himself from cattle, that he may not be cut off. He attains fortune, and obtains cattle who knows thus. The wife is led forward from the back place; &lsquo;Homage to thee, O extended one&rsquo;, he says; the extended are the rays of the sun [3]; verily he pays homage to them. &lsquo;Come forward, irresistible&rsquo;, he says; the resisting is the foe; (verily it serves) to beat away the foe. &lsquo;Along the stream of ghee, with offspring, with increase of wealth&rsquo;, he says; verily he invokes this blessing. &lsquo;O ye waters, goddesses, purifying&rsquo;, he says; that is according to the text.</p>
<h4 id="09-34">09</h4>
<p>When the beast is offered in sacrifice, pain seizes its vital airs. &lsquo;Let thy speech swell, let thy breath swell&rsquo; he says; verily he removes the pain from the vital airs. From the vital airs the pain enters the earth; (with the words) &lsquo;Hail to the and night!&rsquo; he pours it down; verily he removes the pain of the earth by day and night. &lsquo;O plant, protect him&rsquo;, &lsquo;O axe, harm him not&rsquo;, he says; the axe is a thunderbolt [1]; (verily it serves) for atonement. He cuts from the sides, for men cut from the middle; be cuts crossways, for men cut along; for distinction. &lsquo;Thou art the share of the Raksases &lsquo;, (with these words) he casts the strew, having anointed it on the thick part; verily with the blood he propitiates the Raksases. &lsquo;This Raksas here I lead to the lowest darkness, who hateth us and whom we hate&rsquo;, he says; there are two (kinds of) persons, he whom he [2] hates and he who hates him; both these he leads to the lowest darkness.&rsquo; &lsquo;For food (isé) thee!&rsquo; (with these words) he draws out the omentum, for he who sacrifices strives as it were. If he were to pierce (it), Rudra would be likely to slay his cattle; if he were not to pierce (it), it would not be fixed; with one he pierces, with the other not, for support. &lsquo;In ghee, O sky and earth, be covered&rsquo;, he says; verily with fat he anoints sky and earth. &lsquo;Uncut [3] with wealth of heroes (give us) riches&rsquo;, he says; that is according to the text. Now cruel as it were is what he does when he draws out the omentum. &lsquo;Fare along the broad atmosphere&rsquo;, he says, for atonement. Now he who grasps hold of the beast as it is led to death falls away from this world; he takes again hold of the omentum-forks; verily he finds support in this world. With the fire he goes in front, to smite away the Raksases; verily also with the oblation he follows the deities [4]. He should not pass over the last of the embers; if he were to pass over the last of the embers, he would despise the deities. &lsquo;O Vayu, taste the drops&rsquo;, he says; therefore the drops are produced separately. The omentum is the chief part of cattle, the strew the chief of plants; verily he unites the chief with the chief; verily also in the plants he establishes cattle. &lsquo;Give directions for the Svaha cries&rsquo;, he says [5], for the completion of the sacrifice. The speckled butter is the expiration and inspiration of cattle, the omentum is the body; having poured butter on the speckled ghee,&rsquo; he pours on the omentum; verily in the body of cattle he deposits expiration and inspiration. &lsquo;Hail! Go to Urdhvanabhas, the offspring of the Maruts&rsquo;, he says; Urdhvanabhas, the offspring of the Maruts, used to cast forward the omentum-forks of the gods; verily through him he casts them forward. He casts them forward in opposite directions; therefore expiration and inspiration are in opposite directions.</p>
<h4 id="10-33">10</h4>
<p>Having offered in sacrifice the beast, he strews over (it) a cake, verily he sacrifices it with its sap. Having performed the rite with the omentum, he performs with the cake; the cake is strength; verily he places strength in the midst of cattle; verily also he closes the cut in the beast. Having made offering of the speckled ghee, he thrice asks, &lsquo;Is the oblation cooked, Çamitr?&rsquo; for the gods found truth in three (cookings). He who says what is not cooked is cooked (is burdened) with sin. The speckled butter is the expiration and the inspiration of cattle [1]; when the beast is offered the body comes into the heart; in that he sprinkles the heart with speckled ghee, he thus places expiration and inspiration in the body of cattle. By means of the beast the gods went to the world of heaven. They reflected, &lsquo;Men will mount after us.&rsquo; They cut off its head and made its sap stream forth; it became the Praksa (tree); that is the nature of the Praksa. In that there is a branch of the Praksa above the strew, so he cuts off from the victim when it has its sap [2]. As the beast is borne along the Raksases follow after it; he takes it between the sacrificial post and the Ahavaniya, to smite away the Raksases. When the beast is offered its mind departs. &lsquo;Recite to Manota, for the oblation which is being divided&rsquo;, he says verily he secures its mind. He cuts off eleven portions; ten are the vital airs of the beast, the body is the eleventh, he cuts off as much as is the size of the beast [3]. First he makes a portion of the heart, then of the tongue, then of the breast: what he conceives with the heart, that he says with the tongue; what he says with the tongue, that he utters from the breast. That is the order in the case of the beast. If he cuts off thus and then cuts from the rest at will, still the cutting off from that animal has been made in order. In the middle he makes a portion of the intestines, for breath is in the middle; he makes a portion of the upper part [4], for breath is in the upper part; whether he does one, or the other, there is variation in both cases. A Brahman on birth is born with a threefold debt, of pupilship to the Rsis, of sacrifice to the gods, of offspring to the Pitrs. He is freed from his debt who has a son, is a sacrificer, and who has lived as a pupil: this (debt) he</p>
<p>performs (ávadayate) by these cuttings off', and that is why the cuttings-off (avadána) have their name. The gods and the Asuras were in conflict. The gods said to Agni, &lsquo;With thee as our hero let us overcome the Asuras&rsquo; [5]. He said, &lsquo;Let me choose a boon; let me have a choice part of the beast.&rsquo; He chose that choice part (of the beast), the shoulder from the fore part, the intestines from the middle, the hip from the hind part. Then the gods prospered, the Asuras were defeated; in that he makes portions of three members it is for the overcoming of his foe; he prospers himself, his foe is defeated. He cuts off transversely; therefore cattle move forward their limbs transversely, for support.</p>
<h4 id="11-33">11</h4>
<p>He covers the dipping-spoons with fat; cattle are distinguished by fat; verily he bestows on cattle their distinguishing mark. He covers (them) after putting (the fat) on the soup; the soup is the sap of cattle; verily he bestows sap upon cattle. He stirs the oblation of fat with the rib; the rib is the middle of cattle, the fat is the sap of cattle; in that he stirs the oblation of fat with the rib, he places sap in the middle of cattle. Now they kill [1] the beast when they dispose of it; the expiration has Indra for its deity, the inspiration has Indra also. &lsquo;May Indra&rsquo;s expiration be set in every limb&rsquo;, he says; verily he bestows expiration and inspiration upon cattle. &lsquo;O god Tvastr, let much be united for thee&rsquo;, he says; for cattle have Tvastr as their deity. &lsquo;When ye that are various become of one form&rsquo;, he says; for they being various become then of one form. &lsquo;Over thee as thou goest among the gods [2] for help let thy comrades and thy father and mother rejoice&rsquo;, he says; verily he makes him, approved by his mother and his father, go to the world of heaven. With a half-verse be offers the oblation of fat; the half-verse is yonder (sky) and the half-verse is this (earth); verily with sap he adorns both. He offers to the quarters; verily with sap he adorns the quarters; verily from the quarters he wins strength and sap. The speckled butter is the expiration and the inspiration of cattle; cattle have the lord of the forest [3] for their deity; in that having made offering of the speckled butter he says, &lsquo;Recite for the lord of the forest, give directions for the lord of the forest&rsquo;, he bestows expiration and inspiration upon cattle. Of each he divides the divided pieces; there fore cattle have various forms. He moistens (it) with soup; soup is the sap of cattle; verily he bestows sap upon cattle. He invokes the Ida; the Ida is cattle; verily he invokes cattle. Four times he invokes [4], for cattle have four feet. If he desire of a man, &lsquo;May he have no cattle&rsquo;, he should take for him (a piece) without fat; cattle are distinguished by fat; verily by means of their distinctive mark he deprives him of cattle, and he has no cattle. If he desire of a man, &lsquo;May he have cattle&rsquo;, he should take for him (a piece) with fat; cattle are distinguished by fat; verily by means of their distinctive mark he wins cattle for him, and he has cattle. Prajapati created the sacrifice; he first created the butter [5], in the middle the beast, last the speckled butter; therefore the fore-sacrifices are performed with butter, the beast (is offered) in the middle, and the after-sacrifices with speckled butter. Therefore that is mixed as it were, for it was created last. He offers eleven after-sacrifices; ten are the vital airs of the beast, the body is the eleventh; he offers as many after-sacrifices as is the size of the beast. Now they kill the beast when they dispose of it; the speckled butter is the expiration and the inspiration of cattle; in that he per forms the after-sacrifices with speckled butter, verily he bestows expiration and inspiration upon cattle.</p>

<h4 id="01-34">01</h4>
<p>By means of the sacrifice Prajapati created offspring; verily he created them by the subsidiary sacrifices; in that he offers the subsidiary sacrifices, verily thus the sacrificer creates offspring. He cuts off from the hind portion, for from the hind portion offspring are born; he cuts off from the thick side, for offspring are born from the thick side; he cuts off without confusion, to prevent confusion of the vital airs. He does not turn (it) round; if he were to turn (it) round, disease would be likely to seize his offspring. &lsquo;Go to the ocean, hail!&rsquo; he says verily thus he produces seed [1]. &lsquo;Go</p>
<p>to the atmosphere, hail!&rsquo; he says; verily by means of the atmosphere he begets offspring for him, for in accord with the atmosphere offspring are born. &lsquo;Go to god Savitr, hail!&rsquo; he says; verily, instigated by Savitr, he begets offspring for him. &lsquo;Go to day and night, hail!&rsquo; he says; verily by means of day and night he begets offspring for him, for in accord with day and night offspring are born. &lsquo;Go to Mitra and Varuna, hail!&rsquo; he says [2]; verily he bestows expiration and inspiration on offspring when born. &lsquo;Go to Soma, hail!&rsquo; he says, for offspring have Soma for their deity. &lsquo;Go to the sacrifice, hail!&rsquo; he says; verily he makes offspring fit for the sacrifice. &lsquo;Go to the metres, hail!&rsquo; he says; the metres are cattle; verily he wins cattle. &lsquo;Go to the sky and the earth, hail!&rsquo; he says; verily on either side he supports offspring when born with the sky and the earth. &lsquo;Go to the clouds [3] of the sky, hail!&rsquo; he says; verily he procures rain for offspring when born; &lsquo;Go to Agni Vaiśvanara, hail!&rsquo; he says; verily he establishes in this (world) offspring when born. He makes a portion of the vital airs, who makes a portion of the intestines; &lsquo;Give me mind and heart&rsquo;, he says; verily he summons the vital airs according to their places. When the beast is offered, pain reaches its heart; it gathers round the heart-spit [4]. if he were to place the heart-spit on the earth, he would cause pain to the earth; if on the waters, he would cause pain to the waters; he places it in the meeting-place of dry and wet, to appease both. He should think of whomsoever he hates; verily he causes him pain.</p>
<h4 id="02-34">02</h4>
<p>The gods divided the sacrifice on the Agnidh&rsquo;s altar: of what was left over they said, &lsquo;Let this remain here.&rsquo; That is why the Vasativari (waters) have their name. But in the morning they could not arrange (to divide it); they placed it in the waters, they became the Vasativaris. He takes the Vasativaris; the Vasativaris are the sacrifice; verily having taken from the beginning the sacrifice he stays (with it). If the sun set, on one who has not taken (the waters), his sacrifice would not be begun [1], and he would split the sacrifice. He should either take waters with radiance in them, or having deposited gold he takes them with light in them, or he should take them from the tank of a Brahman who performs many sacrifices, for he is one who has taken the Vasativaris. He takes the Vasativaris; the Vasativaris are cattle; verily having taken cattle from the beginning he stays (with them). If he were to take them along the stream, his cattle would be likely to wander from him; he takes them standing against the stream; verily he obstructs cattle and seizes them for him. Indra [2] slew Vrtra; he died upon the waters; of them what was pure, fit for sacrifice, and divine, that was set free. They became the Vahantis. He takes of the Vahantis; verily he takes those of waters which are pure, fit for sacrifice, and divine. He should not pass over the nearest Vahantis; if he were to pass over the nearest Vahantis, he would despise the sacrifice. He should not take of stagnant (waters); the stagnant (waters) are seized by Varuna; if he were to take of stagnant (waters) [3], be would cause Varuna to seize his sacrifice. If it is done by day, the night enters the waters; therefore the waters appear dusky by day; if it is done by night, the day enters the waters; therefore the waters appear shining by night; he takes (them) at the union of shade and light; verily for him he secures the colour of day and night. &lsquo;These waters are rich in oblation&rsquo;, he says; verily he takes them made into an oblation. &lsquo;Rich in oblation be [4] the sun&rsquo;, be says; verily he takes them with light in them. He takes with an Anustubh; the Anustubh is speech; verily with the whole of speech he takes them. He takes with a verse of four feet, he places them thrice, they make up seven, the Çakvari has seven feet, the Çakvari is cattle; verily he wins cattle. For this world the Garhapatya is established, for yonder the Ahavaniya; if he were to place (them) on the Garhapatya, he would have cattle in this world, if on the Ahavaniya, in yonder [5] world he would have cattle. He places (them) on both; verily he makes him have cattle in both worlds. He carries (them) round everywhere, to smite away the Raksases. &lsquo;Ye are the share of Indra and Agni&rsquo;, he says; that is according to the text. He places (them) on the Agnidh&rsquo;s altar; the Agnidh&rsquo;s altar is the invincible part of the sacrifice; verily he places (them) on the invincible part of the sacrifice. Wherever in the performance of a sacrifice nothing is done, in that (place) the Raksases infest the sacrifice. In that he takes of the Vahantis, that part of the sacrifices lies being performed, to prevent the infestation of the Raksases, for they do not move them, but they lie around until the third pressing, for the continuity of the sacrifice.</p>
<h4 id="03-35">03</h4>
<p>The theologians say, &lsquo;He indeed would be an Adhvaryu who in making Soma descend should make it descend for all the gods.&rsquo; &lsquo;To the heart thee!&rsquo; he says; verily he makes it for men; &lsquo;To mind thee!&rsquo; he says; verily he makes it for the Pitrs; &lsquo;To the sky thee! To the sun thee!&rsquo; he says; verily he makes it for the gods; so many are the gods; verily he makes it descend for them all. Before the utterance of speech [1] he begins the morning litany; verily he wins all that there is of speech. &lsquo;The waters&rsquo; is the first thing he utters; the waters are the sacrifice verily over the sacrifice he utters speech. He recites all (kinds of) metres the metres are cattle; verily he wins cattle. For one who desires brilliance he should conclude with a Gayatri verse, for one who desires power with a Tristubh verse, for one who desires cattle with a Jagati verse, for one who desires support with an Anustubh verse, for one who desires the sacrifice with a Pankti verse, for one who desires food with a Viraj verse. &lsquo;Let Agni (kindled) with the kindling-stick hear my appeal&rsquo;, he says [2]; verily, instigated by Savitr, having made proclamation to the gods, he goes for the waters. &lsquo;O Hotr, give directions for the waters&rsquo;, he says; for an action which is directed is done. &lsquo;O bowl priest of the Maitravaruna, run hither&rsquo;. he says; Mitra and Varuna are the leaders of the waters; verily with them he goes for them. &lsquo;O ye divine waters, child of the water&rsquo;, he says; verily by the oblation requiting them he seizes them: then he takes of them made into an oblation and covered with ghee [3]. &lsquo;Thou art the dragger&rsquo;, he says; verily he removes dirt from them. &lsquo;I draw you for the sustenance of the ocean&rsquo;, he says; therefore the waters though eaten and drunk do not waste away. The pit is the birthplace of the sacrifice, the Vasairivaris are the sacrifice; bringing the bowls of the Hotr and the Maitravaruna into contact he pours in the Vasativaris reciprocally, so that the sacrifice may have its birthplace; verily he produces it from its own birthplace. &lsquo;O Adhvaryu, didst thou seek the waters?&rsquo; he says; &lsquo;they came to me; look upon them&rsquo;, in effect he says. If it is an Agnistoma, he makes a libation; if an Ukthya, he rubs (butter) on the enclosing-sticks; if it is an Atiratra, he goes forward uttering a text, to distinguish the sacrifices.</p>
<h4 id="04-36">04</h4>
<p>&lsquo;On the instigation of god Savitr (with these words) he takes up the pressing-stone, for instigation, &lsquo;with the arms of the Aśvins&rsquo;, he says; for the Aśvins were the Adhvaryus of the gods; &lsquo;with the hands of Pusan&rsquo;, he says, for support. The Soma is cattle, the Upanśu pressing-(stone) is cross breathing; in that he measures round the Upanśu pressing-(stone), he confers cross-breathing upon cattle. &lsquo;To Indra thee! To Indra thee!&rsquo; (with these words) he measures, for the Soma is taken for Indra. Five times he measures with the text [1]; the Pankti has five syllables, the sacrifice is fivefold, verily he wins the sacrifice. Five times (he measures) in silence; these make up ten; the Viraj has ten syllables, the Viraj is food; verily he wins food by the Viraj. &lsquo;Ye are savoury, conquerors of Vrtra&rsquo;, he says; this is the Soma-drinking of the waters; he who knows thus reaches not destruction in the waters. &lsquo;With thy light which is in the sky&rsquo;, he says; verily from these worlds he gathers him [2]. Soma, the king, reflected on the quarters, he entered the quarters; &lsquo;forward, behind, upward, downward&rsquo;, he says, verily from the quarters he gathers him; verily also he wins the quarters for him. &lsquo;O mother, come forth&rsquo;, he says; women are likely to desire him who knows thus. &lsquo;Thy unerring, watchful name, O Soma&rsquo;, he says [3]; this is Soma&rsquo;s Soma-drinking; he who knows thus reaches not destruction from Soma. When they press Soma they kill him; he keeps back shoots; verily he protects him. The shoots are the vital airs, Soma is cattle; he later lets go the shoots; verily he bestows vital airs upon cattle; two by two he lets them go; therefore the vital airs are in pairs.</p>
<h4 id="05-36">05</h4>
<p>The Upanśu Cup is breath; in that the cups are drawn beginning with the Upanśu, they follow on breath. Aruna Aupaveśi used to say, &lsquo;At the morning pressing I establish the sacrifice and then I proceed with it when it has been established.&rsquo; He first presses eight times; the Gayatri has eight syllables, the morning pressing is connected with the Gayatri; verily thereby he obtains the morning pressing. (He presses) eleven times on the second occasion; the Tristubh has eleven syllables, the midday pressing is connected with the Tristubh [1]; verily thereby he obtains the midday pressing. (He presses) twelve times on the third occasion; the Jagati has twelve syllables, the third pressing is</p>
<p>connected with the Jagati; verily thereby he obtains the third pressing. This is what he calls the establishment of the sacrifice, to prevent loss; for what falls when the sacrifice is established is not lost. Or rather they say, &lsquo;The Gayatri is not open to question&rsquo; at the morning pressing&rsquo;; he who knows thus is not liable to question from his foe; therefore eight times in each case should press [2]. The theologians say, &lsquo;Other cups are drawn with a strainer; what strainer has the Upanśu?&rsquo; &lsquo;Speech is the strainer&rsquo;, he should reply. &lsquo;Be pure for the lord of speech, O strong one&rsquo;, he says; verily by speech he purifies him. &lsquo;With the shoots of the male&rsquo;, he says, for the shoots of the Soma are the shoots of the male; &lsquo;purified by the arms&rsquo;, he says, for by the arms he purifies him; &lsquo;thou art the god, purifier of gods&rsquo;, he says, for he being a god [3] is the purifier of gods; &lsquo;to those thee whose portion thou art&rsquo;, he says, for he draws him for those whose portion he is. &lsquo;Thou art he who is appropriated&rsquo;, he says; verily he makes breath his own; &lsquo;make our food full of sweetness for us&rsquo;, he says; verily he makes all food sweet for him; &lsquo;to all the powers of sky and earth thee!&rsquo; he says; verily upon both gods and men he bestows the vital airs. &lsquo;May mind enter thee!&rsquo; he says [4]; verily he attains mind. &lsquo;Fare along the broad atmosphere&rsquo;, he says, for the breath has the atmosphere as its deity. &lsquo;Hail! Thee, of kindly nature, to the sun!&rsquo; he says; the gods of kindly nature are the breaths; verily in them he secretly offers. &lsquo;To the gods that drink the rays thee!&rsquo; he says; the gods that drink the rays are the rays of the sun; that is their share; verily thereby he delights them. If he desire, &lsquo;May Parjanya rain&rsquo; [5], he should rub (the cup) with the (palm of) the hand downwards; verily he brings down the rain. If he desire, &lsquo;May it not rain&rsquo;, he should rub with the hand upwards; verily he keeps up the rain. If he practise witchcraft, &lsquo;Slay N.N.; then will I sacrifice to thee&rsquo;, he should say; verily desiring the libation he slays him. If he be far away, he should stand until he is weary; verily he follows his breath and slays him. If he practise witchcraft [6], he should put (it) down (with the words), &lsquo;I set thee down on the breath of N.N.'; the breath is restless; verily he brings his breath to rest. He purifies by means of six shoots; the seasons are six; verily he purifies him by means of the seasons; thrice he purifies these worlds are three; verily he purifies him by means of these worlds. The theologians say, &lsquo;For what reason is it that three animals take by the hand?&rsquo; In that thrice he draws separately the Upanśu with his hand, therefore there are three animals which take by the hand, man, the elephant, and the ape.</p>
<h4 id="06-36">06</h4>
<p>Whatever the gods did as the sacrifice, that the Asuras did. The gods saw that the sacrifice must be established in the Upanśu (cup), and they established it in the Upanśu. The Asuras grasping the thunderbolt attacked the gods; the gods in fear ran up to Indra, Indra obstructed them&rsquo; by means of the Antaryama (cup), and that is why the Antaryama has its name, &lsquo;the obstructor&rsquo;. In that the Antaryama cup is drawn, verily thus the sacrificer obstructs his foes. &lsquo;Through thee I interpose sky and earth [1], I interpose the broad atmosphere&rsquo;, he says; verily with these worlds the sacrificer obstructs his foes. The gods reflected, &lsquo;Indra hath now become what we are&rsquo;; they said, &lsquo;O bounteous one, give us a share&rsquo;; &lsquo;In unison with the gods, the lower and the higher&rsquo;, he replied; to both (the sets of) gods, the lower and the higher [2], he gave a share. &lsquo;In unison with the gods, the lower and the higher&rsquo;, he says; to both (the sets of) gods, the lower and the higher, he gives a share. &lsquo;O bounteous one, do thou rejoice in the Antaryama&rsquo;, he says; verily he does not cut off the sacrificer from the sacrifice. &lsquo;Thou art taken with a support&rsquo;, he says, for the support of inspiration. If both (cups) were drawn without a filter, inspiration would follow expiration, he would be likely to die. The Antaryama is drawn with a filter [3], to separate expiration and inspiration. The Upanśu and the Antaryama (cups) are expiration and inspiration, the Upanśu pressing-(stone) is cross-breathing. If he desire of a man, &lsquo;May he be likely to die&rsquo;, he should set them down for him without being in contact; verily he severs his expiration and inspiration from cross-breathing; swiftly he dies. If he desire of a man, &lsquo;May he live all his days&rsquo;, he should set them down for him in contact; verily he connects his expiration and inspiration with cross-breathing; he lives all his days.</p>
<h4 id="07-35">07</h4>
<p>The cup for Indra and Vayu is speech; in that the cups are drawn beginning with that to Indra and Vayu, verily they follow speech. The gods said to Vayu, &lsquo;Let us slay Soma, the king&rsquo;; he replied,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me choose a boon; let your cups be drawn with mine first.&rsquo; Therefore the cups are drawn with those for Indra and Vayu first. They slew him; he became putrid; the gods could not endure him, they said to Vayu, &lsquo;Make him sweet for us&rsquo; [1]; he replied, &lsquo;Let me choose a boon; let your vessels, be said to have me as their deity.&rsquo; Therefore, being of various deities, they are said to have Vayu as their deity. Verily did Vayu make him sweet for him; therefore what becomes putrid they hang out in a windy place, for Vayu is its purifier, its sweetener. They could not find its distribution; Aditi said, &lsquo;Let me choose a boon; then shall ye distribute through me, verily with me as deity may your Soma (draughts) be set down&rsquo; [2]. &lsquo;Thou art taken with a support&rsquo;, he says, and thereby have they Aditi for their deity, for those vessels that are made of wood are born from her womb, those that are made of clay are clearly hers; therefore he says thus. Speech aforetime spoke without discrimination; the gods said to Indra, &lsquo;Do thou discriminate this speech for us&rsquo;; he replied, &lsquo;Let me choose a boon; let this (cup) be drawn for me and for Vayu together.&rsquo; Therefore the cup is drawn together for Indra and Vayu. Indra approaching it in the midst discriminated it; therefore is speech spoken distinctly. Therefore is it drawn once, in the middle, for Indra, and twice for Vayu, for he chose two boons.</p>
<h4 id="08-34">08</h4>
<p>The gods said to Mitra, &lsquo;Let us slay Soma, the king&rsquo;; he replied, &lsquo;Not I; for I am the friend of all&rsquo;; they answered, &lsquo;Still we will slay him&rsquo;; he replied, &lsquo;Let me choose a boon; let them mix the Soma for me with milk.&rsquo; Therefore they mix with milk (the Soma) for Mitra and Varuna. From him cattle departed (saying), &lsquo;He that was a friend hath done a cruel deed&rsquo;; a cruel deed as it were [1] does he do who sacrifices with Soma; from him cattle depart. In that he mixes with milk (the Soma) for Mitra and Varuna, he unites Mitra with cattle, and the sacrificer with cattle. Aforetime indeed was Mitra thus aware,' When I have done this cruel deed, cattle will depart from me'; therefore he chose thus. The gods said to Varuna, &lsquo;With thee as helper we will slay Soma, the king&rsquo;; he replied, &lsquo;Let me choose a boon, for me [2] and Mitra together let this (cup) be drawn.&rsquo; Therefore it is drawn for Mitra and Varuna together; therefore with a king as helper they slay a king, with a Vaiśya a Vaiśya, with a Çudra a Çudra. This was not day or night, but undiscriminated; the gods said to Mitra and Varuna, &lsquo;Make this to shine forth for us&rsquo;; they replied, &lsquo;Let us choose a boon; let one cup only be drawn before ours.&rsquo; Therefore the cup for Indra and Vayu is drawn before that for Mitra and Varuna, for the Upanśu and the Antaryama (cups) are expiration and inspiration. Mitra produced the day, Varuna the night; then indeed did this shine forth; in that (a cup) is drawn for Mitra and Varuna, (it is) for shining forth.</p>
<h4 id="09-35">09</h4>
<p>The head of the sacrifice was cut; the gods said to the Aśvins, Ye are physicians; do ye replace the head of the sacrifice', they replied. Let us choose a boon; let there be drawn a cup for us also herein.' For them they drew this cup for the Aśvins; then indeed did they replace the head of the sacrifice; in that (the cup) for the Aśvins is drawn, (it is) to restore the sacrifice. The gods said of these two, &lsquo;Impure are they, wandering among men [1] and physicians.&rsquo; Therefore a Brahman should not practise medicine, for the physician is impure, unfit for the sacrifice. Having purified them by the Bahispavamana (Stotra) they drew for them this cup for the Aśvins; therefore (the cup) for the Aśvins is drawn when the Bahispavamana has been sung. Therefore by one who knows thus the Bahispavamana should be performed; verily he purifies himself. Their skill as physicians they deposited in three places, in Agni a third, in the waters a third, in the Brahman a third. Therefore one should put beside him a pot of water [2] and sit on the right hand of a Brahman when practising medicine; all medicine he performs thereby, his remedy becomes effective. The theologians say, &lsquo;For what reason are cups for two deities drawn in one vessel, but offered in two?&rsquo; In that (the cups) are drawn in one vessel, therefore there is one breath within; they are offered in two vessels, therefore the breaths outside are in pairs. Those that are for two deities are the breaths, the Ida is cattle; if he should summon the Ida before those that are for two deities [3], he would obstruct his breaths by cattle, he would be likely to perish. Having eaten those for two deities, he summons the Ida; verily having placed the breaths in himself he summons the Ida. (The cup) for Indra and Vayu</p>
<p>is speech, that for Mitra and Varuna is the eye, that for the Aśvins is the ear; he eats in front that for Indra and Vayu, therefore in front he speaks with speech; in front that for Mitra and Varuna, therefore in front he sees with the eye; moving all round, that for the Aśvins; therefore on all sides he hears with the ear. Those for two deities are the breaths [4], he sets down full vessels; therefore the breaths are full within; wherever in the performance of the sacrifice nothing is done, in that place the Raksases attack the sacrifice; in that he sets down full vessels the part of the sacrifice being performed is deposited to prevent the entry of the Raksases. He sets down in the north track of the southern oblation-cart; verily he places speech in speech. They lie (there) until the third pressing, for the continuity of the sacrifice.</p>
<h4 id="10-34">10</h4>
<p>Brhaspati was the Purohita of the gods, Çanda and Marka of the Asuras; the gods had the holy power (Brahman), the Asuras had the holy power (Brahman); they could not overcome one another; the gods invited Çanda and Marka; they replied, &lsquo;Let us choose a boon; let cups be drawn for us also herein.&rsquo; For them they drew these cups for Çukra and Manthin; then did the gods prosper, the Asuras were defeated. He for whom knowing thus these Çukra and Manthin (cups) are drawn, prospers himself, his foe [1] is defeated. Having driven away these two, the gods offered to themselves,' to Indra. &lsquo;Driven away are Çanda and Marka together with N.N.&rsquo;, he should say of whom he hates; with him whom he hates he thus drives them away. &lsquo;This is the first preparer, all maker&rsquo;, (with these words) they offered to themselves, to Indra, these (cups), for Indra kept making these forms. The Çukra is yonder sun, the Manthin is the moon; they depart towards the east, closing their eyes [2]; therefore men do not see them as they go east. Turning back towards the west they sacrifice, therefore men see them going west. The Çukra and the Manthin are the eyes of the sacrifice, the high altar is the nose. They offer having gone round (the altar) on both sides; therefore the eyes are on either side of the nose; therefore the eyes are held apart by the nose; they walk round on all sides, to smite away the Raksases. Now the offerings the gods made on the east, with them they drove away the Asuras who were in front [3]; with those on the west they drove away the Asuras who were behind; other sacrifices are made in the east, the Çukra and Manthin on the west; verily behind and in front the sacrificer drives away his foes; therefore offspring are engendered behind and are brought forth in front. In accordance with the Çukra and Manthin are offspring born, the eaters and the eaten. &lsquo;Engendering heroic off spring), come forth, Çukra, with pure radiance&rsquo; [4], &lsquo;Engendering prolific offspring, come forth, Manthin, with mixed radiance&rsquo;, he says; &lsquo;the eaters are those who are heroic, the eaten those that are prolific. The offspring of him who knows thus becomes an eater, not eaten. The eye of Prajapati swelled; it fell away, it entered the Vikankata, it did not stay in the Vikankata; it entered barley, it stayed in barley; that is why barley has its name [5]. In that the Manthin vessel is of Vikankata and he mixes with groats, verily thus he gathers together the eye of Prajapati. The theologians say, &lsquo;For what reason does the Manthin vessel not go to the Sadas?&rsquo; &lsquo;It is the vessel of misfortune&rsquo;, he should say; if it were to go there, the Adhvaryu would be blind, he would be ruined; therefore it does not go there.</p>
<h4 id="11-34">11</h4>
<p>Whatever the gods did at the sacrifice the Asuras did. The gods saw the cups with the Agrayana at their head; they drew them; then indeed did they reach the top; he for whom knowing thus the cups are drawn with the Agrayana at their head reaches the top of his equals. With a verse containing the word &lsquo;destructive&rsquo; he should draw for him who has a rival; verily having destroyed his rival he reaches the top of his equals. &lsquo;Ye gods that are eleven in the sky&rsquo;, he says [1]; so many are the deities; verily he draws it for all of them. &lsquo;This is thy birthplace; to the All-gods thee!&rsquo; he says, for it has the All-gods for its deity. Speech departed from the gods, not being willing to remain for the sacrifice; when speech had departed the gods silently drew the cups; speech reflected, &lsquo;They are excluding me&rsquo;; it went into the Agrayana; that is why the Agrayana has its name [2]. Therefore in the Agrayana speech is uttered. In that the former cups are drawn in silence, that is as when the hunter lets go (his arrow), (thinking), &lsquo;So far off is my mark at so far I shall not miss.&rsquo; The Adhvaryu taking the Agrayana, commencing the sacrifice, utters his speech; thrice he utters &lsquo;Him&rsquo;; verily thus</p>

<p>Indra raised his bolt to hurl at Vrtra; Vrtra was afraid of the bolt when raised to be hurled; he said, &lsquo;Hurl it not at me; there is this strength in me, that will I bestow on thee&rsquo;; on him he bestowed the Ukthya. At him he raised (the bolt) to hurl a second time; he said, &lsquo;Hurl it not at me; there is this strength in me, that will I bestow on thee&rsquo; [1]; on him he bestowed again the Ukthya. At him he raised (the bolt) to hurl a third time; Visnu supported him (saying), &lsquo;Smite&rsquo;; he said, &lsquo;Hurl it not at me; there is this strength in me, that will I bestow on thee&rsquo;; he bestowed on him again the Ukthya. Him when he had lost his magic power he slew, for the sacrifice was his magic power. In that the Ukthya is drawn, verily the sacrificer thus appropriates the power [2] and strength of his foe. &lsquo;To Indra thee, to him of the Brhat, the strong&rsquo;, he says, for to Indra he gave it; &lsquo;to him thee! To Visnu thee!&rsquo; he says; in that Visnu supported him (saying), &lsquo;Strike&rsquo;, he gives Visnu a share therein. Thrice he draws, for thrice he gave to him., This is thy birthplace; thou art the renewed offering&rsquo;, he says, for repeatedly [3] he draws from it. The Ukthya is the eye of the sacrifice; therefore the Somas follow the Ukthya when offered; therefore the body follows the eye; therefore as one goes many follow; therefore one becomes superior among many; therefore one wins many wives. If the Adhvaryu desire, &lsquo;May I bestow upon myself the glory of the sacrifice&rsquo;, standing between the Ahavaniya and the oblation-holder he should pour (it) down [4]; verily he bestows upon himself the glory of the sacrifice. If he desire, &lsquo;May I bestow upon the sacrificer the glory of the sacrifice&rsquo;, he should pour (it) down standing between the Sadas and the oblation-holder; verily he bestows upon the sacrificer the glory of the sacrifice. If he desire, &lsquo;May I bestow upon the Sadasyas the glory of the sacrifice&rsquo;, he should pour (it) down, grasping the Sadas; verily he bestows upon the Sadasyas the glory of the sacrifice.</p>
<h4 id="02-35">02</h4>
<p>The Dhruva (cup) is the life of the sacrifice; it is drawn the last of the cups; therefore life is the last of the breaths. &lsquo;The head of the sky, the messenger of earth&rsquo;, he says; verily he makes him the head of his equals. &lsquo;Vaiśvanara, born for holy order&rsquo;, he says, for life has Vaiśvanara as its deity. It is drawn with Vaiśvanara on both sides; therefore there are breaths on both sides, below and above. The other cups that are drawn make a half, the Dhruva makes a half; therefore [1] the breath below is a half of the other breaths. The other cups are deposited on strewn (ground), the Dhruva on unstrewn; therefore in bone some creatures find support, in flesh others. The Asuras from above desired to turn round the earth; the gods made it firm (adrnhan) with the Dhruva; that is why the Dhruva has its name; in that the Dhruva is set down from above, (it serves) for firmness. The Dhruva is the life of the sacrifice, the Hotr is the body; in that he pours the Dhruva down into the goblet of the Hotr, so he places life in the body of the sacrifice [2]. &lsquo;Before the Uktha it should be poured down&rsquo;, they say, for in front one enjoys life; &lsquo;In the middle it should be poured down&rsquo;, they say, for the middle one enjoys life; &lsquo;In the latter part it should be poured down&rsquo;, they say, for with the last one enjoys life. He pours (it) down while the verse to the All-gods is being recited; offspring are connected with the All-gods; verily he confers life upon offspring.</p>

<p>By means of the sacrifice the gods went to the world of heaven; they reflected, &lsquo;Men will follow after us here&rsquo;; they blocked (the way) by the year and went to the world of heaven. It the Rsis discerned by means of the season-cups; in that the season-cups are drawn, (they serve) to reveal, the world of heaven. Twelve are drawn; the year consists of twelve months; (verily they serve) to reveal the year. The first two are drawn together, the last two together; therefore the seasons are in pairs. The season-vessel has mouths on both sides, for who [1] knows where is the mouth of the seasons? &lsquo;Give directions for the season&rsquo;, six times he says,' the seasons are six; verily he delights the seasons; &lsquo;For the seasons&rsquo;, four times; verily he delights four-footed cattle; twice again he says, &lsquo;For the season&rsquo;; verily he delights two-footed (cattle). &lsquo;Give directions for the season&rsquo;, six times he says; &lsquo;For the seasons&rsquo;, four times; therefore four-footed cattle depend upon the seasons; twice [2] again, &lsquo;For the season&rsquo;, he says; therefore bipeds live upon quadrupeds. &lsquo;Give directions for the season&rsquo;, six times he says; &lsquo;For the seasons&rsquo;, four times; twice again, &lsquo;For the season&rsquo;; verily the sacrificer makes himself a ladder and bridge to attain the world of heaven. One should not follow the other; if one were to follow the other, season would follow season, the seasons would be confused [3]; therefore in order the Adhvaryu sets out by the southern (door), the Pratiprasthatr by the northern; therefore the sun goes south for six months, north for six months.' &lsquo;Thou art taken with a support; thou art Samsarpa; to Anhaspatya thee!&rsquo; he says; &lsquo;There is a thirteenth month&rsquo;, they say; verily he delights it.</p>

<p>The season-cups are drawn for the world of heaven; Indra and Agni are the light; in that he draws the cup for Indra and Agni with the season-vessel, verily he places light above it, to light up the world of heaven. Indra and Agni are the bearers of force among the gods; in that (the cup) for Indra and Agni is drawn, verily he wins force. He draws (the cup) for the All-gods with the Çukra-vessel; people are connected with the All-gods, the Çukra is yonder sun, in that he draws (the cup) for the All-gods with the Çukra-vessel, yonder sun [1] rises turned to all people; therefore each one thinks, &lsquo;Towards me hath it arisen.&rsquo; He draws (the cup) for the All-gods with the Çukra-vessel; people are connected with the All-gods, the Çukra is brilliance; in that he draws (the cup) for the All-gods with the Çukra vessel, verily he bestows brilliance upon people.</p>

<p>Indra in league with the Maruts slew Vrtra at the midday pressing; in that (the cups) for the Maruts are drawn at the midday pressing, they are drawn for the sacrificer as slaying the foe. Of him, when he had slain Vrtra, the seasons were confused; with the season vessel he drew (the cups) for the Maruts; then indeed did he discern the seasons; in that (the cups) for the Maruts are drawn with the season-vessel, (they serve) to reveal the seasons. (The cups) for the Maruts are a weapon which the sacrificer hurls at his foe; with the first [1] he raises it aloft, with the second he hurls it; with the third he lays (him) low. (The cups) for the Maruts are a weapon which the sacrificer makes ready; the first is a bow, the second a bowstring, the third an arrow; with the first he fits the arrow, with the second he lets it go, with the third he pierces. Indra having slain Vrtra went to the furthest distance, thinking, &lsquo;I have done amiss&rsquo;; he became of bay colour, he saw these (cups) for the Maruts, to save himself;' he drew them [2]; verily with the first he won expiration, with the second inspiration, himself with the third, (the cups) for the Maruts are drawn to save the self of the sacrificer; verily he wins expiration with the first, inspiration by the second, and himself with the third. Indra slew Vrtra; the gods said of him, &lsquo;Great hath he become who hath slain Vrtra&rsquo;; that is why Mahendra (great Indra) has his name. He drew this libation for Mahendra, having slain Vrtra and being above the other deities; in that (the cup) for Mahendra is drawn, so the sacrificer draws this libation, being above other people. He draws with the Çukra vessel; (the cup) for Mahendra has the sacrificer as its deity, the Çukra is brilliance; in that he draws (the cup) for Mahendra in the Çukra-vessel, verily he bestows brilliance on the sacrificer.</p>

<p>Aditi, desirous of offspring, cooked a Brahman&rsquo;s mess for the Sadhya gods; to her the gave the remains, she ate it, she became pregnant; of her the four Adityas were born. A second (mess) she cooked; she reflected, &lsquo;They have been born for me from the remains; if I eat first, then stronger ones will be born from me&rsquo;; she ate first, she became pregnant, from her was born an egg which miscarried. She cooked a third (mess) for the Adityas [1], (saying) &lsquo;Let this labour be for enjoyment to me&rsquo;; they said, &lsquo;Let us choose a boon; let him who shall be born hence be one of us; let him who shall be prosperous among his offspring be for our enjoyment&rsquo;; then was born the Aditya Vivasvant, men are his offspring here, among them he alone is successful who sacrifices, he serves for enjoyment of the gods. The gods kept Rudra away from the sacrifice [2], he followed the Adityas; they took refuge in (the cups) for two deities, them they did not give up; therefore men do not give up even one worthy of death who has come for help. Therefore (the cup) for the Adityas is drawn from those for two deities, in that they were born from the remnant, therefore it is drawn from the remnant. He draws with three verses; mother, father, son, verily that is this pairing; the amnion, embryo, the chorion, verily that is this [3] pairing. The Aditya (cup) is cattle; curds are strength; he mixes with curds in the middle; verily he places strength in the middle of cattle; (with curds) to be coagulated with boiled milk, for purity. Therefore the raw milks the cooked. The Aditya (cup) is cattle; he-draws after covering (the cup); verily he draws securing cattle for him. The Aditya (cup) is those cattle; Agni is Rudra here; he draws after covering; verily he shuts off cattle from Rudra [4]. (The stone) for pressing out the Upanśu (cup) is this Aditya Vivasvant; it lies round this Soma drink until the third pressing. &lsquo;O bright Aditya, this is thy Soma drink&rsquo;, he says; verily he unites the Aditya Vivasvant with the Soma drink. &lsquo;With the rain of the sky I mix thee&rsquo;, (with these words) he should mix for one who desires rain; verily he wins rain. If it should fall quickly, Parjanya would be likely to rain; if long, (he would) not (be likely). He does not place (the cup) down, for from that which is not depressed offspring are produced. He should not utter the secondary Vasat; if he were to do so, he would let Rudra go after his offspring; after sacrificing he should not look after (it); if he were to look after (it) his eye would be likely to be destroyed; therefore he should not look after (it).</p>

<p>He draws (the cup) for Savitr from the Agrayana with the Antaryama-vessel; the Agrayana is Prajapati; (verily it serves) for the begetting of offspring. He does not place (the cup) down, for from that which is not depressed offspring are produced. He does -not utter the secondary Vasat; if he were to do so, he would let Rudra go after his offspring. Savitr is among the gods he who is connected with the Gayatri; in that the Agrayana (is drawn), it is drawn in the world of the Gayatri; in that he draws (the cup) for Savitr from the Agrayana with the Antaryama vessel, verily he draws it off from its own birthplace. The All-gods [1] could not perform the third pressing; they led Savitr who shares in the first pressing to the third pressing; then indeed they performed the third pressing. In that (the cup) for Savitr is drawn at the third pressing, (it serves) for performing the third pressing. He draws (the cup) for the All-gods from the tub with the Savitr-vessel; people are connected with the All-gods, the tub is connected with the All-gods, Savitr rules instigations; in that he draws (the cup) for the All-gods from the tub with the Savitr vessel, verily instigated by Savitr he produces offspring for him [2]. He draws Soma in Soma; verily thus he impregnates seed. &lsquo;Thou givest good protection, and art well established&rsquo;, he says, for he draws Soma in Soma, for support. In this same cup (offering) is made for men, gods, and Pitrs; &lsquo;Thou givest good protection, and art well established&rsquo;, he says; verily thereby he makes (it) for men; &lsquo;The great&rsquo;, he says; verily thereby he makes (it) for the gods; &lsquo;Homage&rsquo;, he says; verily thereby he makes (it) for the Pitrs; so many are the gods; verily he draws it for them all. &lsquo;This is thy birthplace; to the All-gods thee!&rsquo; he says, for it is connected with the All-gods.</p>

<p>The Upanśu is the breath; in that the first and the, last cups are drawn with the Upanśu-vessel, verily they follow forward the breath, they follow back the breath. The Agrayana is Prajapati, the Upanśu is the breath, the wives produce offspring; in that he draws (the cup) for (Tvastr) with the</p>
<p>wives from the Agrayana with the Upanśu-vessel, (it serves) for the production of offspring. Therefore offspring are born in accordance with the breath. The gods desired that the wives should go to the world of heaven [1]; they could not discern the world of heaven, they saw this (cup) for the wives, they drew it; then indeed did they discern the world of heaven; in that (the cup) for the wives is drawn, (it serves) to reveal the world of heaven. Soma could not bear being drawn for women; making the ghee a bolt they beat it, they drew it when it had lost its power; therefore women are powerless, have no inheritance, and speak more humbly than even a bad man [2]. In that he mixes (the cup) for (Tvastr) with the wives with ghee, he overpowers it with a bolt and draws it. &lsquo;Thou art taken with a support&rsquo;, he says; the support is this (earth); therefore offspring are born on this (earth). &lsquo;Of thee, pressed by Brhaspati &lsquo;, he says; Brhaspati is the holy power of the gods; verily by the holy power he produces offspring for him. &lsquo;O drop&rsquo;, he says; the drop is seed; verily thus he impregnates seed. &lsquo;Possessing power&rsquo;, he says [3]; power is offspring; verily he produces offspring for him. &lsquo;O Agni&rsquo;, he says; the impregnator of seed is Agni; &lsquo;With the wives&rsquo;, he says, for pairing; &lsquo;in unison with the god Tvastr drink the Soma&rsquo;, he says; Tvastr is the maker of the forms of pairings of animals; verily he places form in animals. The gods sought to slay Tvastr; he went to the wives, they would not give him up; therefore [4] men do not give up even one worthy of death who has come for help. Therefore in (the cup) for the wives for Tvastr also a drawing is made. He does not put (the cup) down, for from what is not depressed offspring are produced. He does not utter the secondary Vasat; if he were to do so, he would let Rudra go after his offspring; if he were not to do so, the Agnidh would consume the Soma before it had been appeased; he says the secondary Vasat muttering, he does not let Rudra go after his offspring, the Agnidh consumes the Soma after it has been appeased. &lsquo;O Agnidh, sit on the lap of the Nestr; O Nestr, lead up the wife&rsquo;, he says verily the Agnidh impregnates the Nestr, the Nestr the wife. He causes the Udgatr to look (at the wife); the Udgatr is Prajapati; (verily it serves) for the production of offspring. He causes water to follow along; verily thus he pours seed; along the thigh he causes it to flow, for along the thigh is seed poured; baring the thigh he causes it to flow, for when the thigh is bared, they pair, then seed is poured, then offspring are born.</p>

<p>Indra slew Vrtra; he forced out his skull-bone, it became the wooden tub, from it the Soma flowed, it became (the cup) for the yoker of bays; he reflected regarding it, &lsquo;Shall I offer, or shall I not offer?&rsquo; He reflected, &lsquo;If I shall offer, I shall offer what is raw; if I shall not offer, I shall make confusion in the sacrifice.&rsquo; He decided to offer; Agni said, Thou shalt not offer what is raw in me&rsquo;; he mixed it with fried grains [1], and when it had become cooked he offered it. In that he mixes (the cup) for the yoker of bays with fried grains, (it serves) to make it cooked; verily he offers it when it has become cooked. He mixes with many; so many are his (cows) yielding his wishes in yonder world. Or rather they say,'(The fried grains) for the yoker of bays are the dappled (cows) of Indra yielding wishes&rsquo;; therefore he should mix with many. The bays of Indra, which drink the Soma, are the Rc and the Saman, the enclosing-sticks are their bridles; if he should offer without removing the enclosing-sticks, he would offer fodder to them still bridled [2]; he offers after removing the enclosing-sticks; verily he offers fodder to them with their bridles removed. It is the Unnetr who offers; the Adhvaryu when he has uttered &lsquo;Godspeed!&rsquo; is as one who has finished his journey; if the Adhvaryu were to offer, it would be as when one yokes again (a horse) unyoked. He offers after putting it on his head, for from the head it sprung; he offers after striding, for Indra slew Vrtra after striding; (verily it serves) for attainment. (The grains) for the yoker of bays are cattle; if he were to crush (them), few [3] cattle would attend and wait on him; if he were not to crush them, many cattle would attend, but not wait on him; in his mind he crushes them together, and effects both; many cattle attend and wait on him. They await the invitation from the Unnetr; verily they win the Soma drinking that is here. He throws down (the remnants) on the high altar; the high altar is cattle, (the grains) for the yoker of bays are cattle verily they make cattle find support in cattle.</p>

<p>Offspring and cattle are born through the cups, goats and sheep through the Upanśu and Antaryama, men through the Çukra and Manthin, whole-hooved animals through the season-cups, kine through the Aditya cup. The Aditya cup is drawn with the largest number of Rcs; therefore kine axe the most numerous of cattle; in that he thrice draws apart with his hand the Upanśu (cup), therefore the female goat gives birth to two or three, but sheep are more numerous. The Agrayana is the father, the tub is the son; if the Agrayana is exhausted, he should draw from the tub; that is as when a father [1] in destitution has recourse to his son. If the tub is exhausted, he should draw from the Agrayana; that is as when a son in destitution has recourse to his father. The Agrayana is the self of the sacrifice; if the cup or the tub should be exhausted, he should draw from the Agrayana; verily from the self he develops the sacrifice. The Agrayana is drawn (with a verse) in which there is no discriminating mark; he draws with a pot, he offers with (the vessel) for Vayu; therefore [2] (a man) is a slayer of a Brahman (through slaying) an embryo which has not been discriminated. They go to the final bath; they deposit the pots, but lift up (the vessels) for Vayu; therefore they deposit a daughter on birth, a son they lift up. In that be utters the Puroruc, it is as when one brings (something) to a superior; in that he draws the cup, it is as when having brought (something) to a superior one proclaims (it); in that he puts it down, it is as when having deposited something with a superior one goes away. Whatever of the sacrifice is accompanied by a Saman or Yajus, is loose; whatever by a Rc is firm; they are drawn with a support in front to the accompaniment of a Yajus, (they are drawn) with a support behind to the accompaniment of a Rc, for the support of the sacrifice.</p>
<h4 id="11-35">11</h4>
<p>Some vessels are used (repeatedly), others not. With those that are employed once only (paracínani) he conquers yonder world, for yonder world is as it were turned away (paran). With those which are used again he conquers this world, for this world is repeated as it were again and again. Some vessels are used (repeatedly), and others not. Through those that are used once only the plants fade; through those which are used again [1] the plants revive again. Some vessels are used repeatedly, others not. Through those which are used once only the wild animals go to the forest; through those which are used again the domestic animals come back again to the village. He who knows the foundation of the cups becomes possessed of a (sure) foundation. The hymn called the Ajya (Çastra), that is the foundation of the cups; in that he recites muttering, that [2] is (the foundation) of the Upanśu and the Antaryama (cups); in that (he recites) aloud, that is (the foundation) of the other cups; he who knows thus becomes possessed of a foundation. He who knows the pairing of the cups is propagated with offspring, with cattle, with pairings. Some cups are drawn with pots, some with (vessels) for Vayu; that is the pairing of the cups. He who knows thus is propagated with offspring, with cattle, with pairings. Indra forcibly drank the Soma of Tvastr; he went to pieces on all sides [3]; he found no stay in himself; he saw these cakes ,as an addition to the pressing, them he offered, and with them he made a stay in himself; therefore as additional to the pressing the cakes are offered; therefore as additional to the pressing he should partake of the cakes; verily he makes a stay in himself, and the Soma does not flow through him. The theologians say, &lsquo;Neither by Rc nor by Saman is the five made up; what then is the fivefold character of the sacrifice?&rsquo; Fried grains, mush, rice grains, the cake, clotted milk, thereby the five is made up; that is the fivefold character of the sacrifice.</p>

<p>The sacrifices with the gifts are offered for the world of heaven. He offers with two (verses) on the Garhapatya; the sacrificer has two feet; (verily it serves) for support. He offers in the Agnidh&rsquo;s altar; verily he ascends the atmosphere. He approaches the Sadas; verily he makes him go to the world of heaven. He offers in the Garhapatya with verses addressed to Surya; verily he makes him mount</p>
<p>yonder world. He offers in the Agnidh&rsquo;s altar with a verse containing the word &lsquo;Lead&rsquo;, for leading to the world of heaven. &lsquo;Go to the sky, fly to heaven&rsquo;, (with these words) he takes out the gold after the offering [1]; verily he makes him go to the world of heaven. &lsquo;With my form I approach your form&rsquo;, he says; for by his form he approaches their form, in that (he approaches) with gold. &lsquo;May Tutha, all knowing, allot to you&rsquo;, he says; Tutha, all knowing, was wont to allot the gifts of the gods; verily thereby he divides them. &lsquo;This gift of thine, O Agni [2], cometh, impelled by the Soma&rsquo;, he says, for his gift comes impelled by the Soma. &lsquo;Lead it by the path of Mitra&rsquo;, he says, for atonement. &lsquo;Go ye on by the path of holy order, of brilliant gifts&rsquo;, he says; holy order is truth; verily with truth, with holy order, he divides them. &lsquo;Leading prosperity by the path of the sacrifice&rsquo;, he says, for the gifts go by the path of the sacrifice. &lsquo;May I win a Brahman to-day [3], a seer and sprung from seers&rsquo;, he says; the learned man is a Brahman, a seer and sprung from seers; therefore he says thus. &lsquo;Gaze on the heaven, gaze on the atmosphere&rsquo;, he says; verily he makes him go to the world of' heaven. &lsquo;Join those in the seat&rsquo;, he says, for friendship. &lsquo;Given by us, go to the gods, full of sweetness; enter the giver&rsquo;, he says; &lsquo;we here are givers; do ye there enter us, full of sweetness&rsquo; [4], he says in effect. He gives gold; gold is light; verily he places light before, to light up the world of heaven. He gives to the Agnidh; verily he delights the seasons headed by Agni; he gives to the Brahman priest, for instigation; he gives to the Hotr; the Hotr is the self of the sacrifice; verily he unites the self of the sacrifice with the gifts.</p>
<h4 id="02-36">02</h4>
<p>He offers the Samistayajuses, for the completion of the sacrifice. Whatever is harsh or injured in the sacrifice, what he passes over, what he does not pass over, what he does redundantly, what he does not do, all that he propitiates with them. He offers nine; nine are the breaths in man, the sacrifice is commensurate with man; all the sacrifice he delights thus. He offers six with Rcs; the seasons are six; verily he delights the seasons; he offers three with Yajuses [1]; these worlds are three; verily he delights these worlds. &lsquo;O sacrifice, go to the sacrifice; go to the lord of the sacrifice&rsquo;, he says; verily he makes it go to the lord of the sacrifice. &lsquo;Go to thine own birthplace&rsquo;, he says; verily be makes it go to his own birthplace. &lsquo;This is thy sacrifice, O lord of the sacrifice, with its, utterance of hymns and producing noble heroes&rsquo;, he says; verily he confers strength upon the sacrificer. Vasistha Satyahavya asked Devabhaga, &lsquo;When thou didst cause to sacrifice the Srñjayas, with many sacrificers, didst thou cause the sacrifice to rest upon the sacrifice [2] or on the lord of the sacrifice? He replied, &lsquo;On the lord of the sacrifice.&rsquo; &lsquo;But in truth Srñjayas have been defeated&rsquo;, he said, &lsquo;the sacrifice should have been made to rest on the sacrifice, to prevent the defeat of the sacrificer.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ye gods, that find the way, finding the way, go on the way&rsquo;, he says; verily he makes the sacrifice to rest upon the sacrifice, to prevent the defeat of the sacrificer.</p>
<h4 id="03-37">03</h4>
<p>He offers the Avabhrthayajuses; whatever sin he has committed in the year before, verily that thereby he propitiates. He goes to the waters for the final bath; Varuna is in the waters; verily straightway he propitiates Varuna. The Raksases, following along by the path, seek to injure the sacrifice; the Prastotr follows along with the Saman, the slayer of Raksases, is the Saman; (verily it serves) for the smiting away of the Raksases. Thrice he performs the finale; these worlds are three; verily from these worlds [1] he smites away the Raksases. Each one performs the finale; for each one is infested by the Raksases, for the smiting away of the Raksases. &lsquo;King Varuna hath made a broad (path)&rsquo;, he says, for support. &lsquo;A hundred remedies are thine, O king, a thousand&rsquo;, he says; verily he makes medicine for him. &lsquo;The noose of Varuna is overcome&rsquo;, he says verily he overcomes the noose of Varuna. He makes offering over the strew, for the support of the oblations; verily also he offers in what has fire. He offers the fore-offerings omitting that to the strew [2]; the strew is offspring; verily he frees offspring from Varuna&rsquo;s noose. He offers the two portions of butter; verily he does not obstruct the two eyes of the sacrifice. He sacrifices to Varuna; verily he frees him from Varuna&rsquo;s noose. He sacrifices to Agni and Varuna; verily straightway he frees him from Varuna&rsquo;s noose. He offers two after-offerings, omitting that to the strew; the strew is offspring; verily he frees offspring from Varuna&rsquo;s noose. He offers four fore-offerings and two after-offerings; they make up</p>
<p>six, the seasons are six [3]; verily he finds support in the seasons. &lsquo;O bath, O flood&rsquo;, he says; verily he propitiates by this utterance Varuna. In the sea is thy heart, within the waters&rsquo;, he says, for Varuna is in the sea. &lsquo;Let the plants and the waters enter thee&quot; he says; verily he unites him with the waters and the plants. &lsquo;Ye divine waters, this is thy foetus&rsquo;, he says; that is according to the text. The Soma is cattle [4]; if he were to partake of the drops, he would be possessed of cattle, but Varuna would seize him; if he were not to partake, he would have no cattle, but Varuna would not seize him; he should touch them only, he becomes possessed of cattle, Varuna seizes him not. &lsquo;The noose of Varuna is loosed&rsquo;, he says; verily is he freed from Varuna&rsquo;s noose. They advance without looking round, for concealment from Varuna. &lsquo;Thou art fuel may we prosper&rsquo;, he says; verily with the kindling-stick they approach the fire in reverence. &lsquo;Thou art brilliance; grant me brilliance&rsquo;, he says; verily he bestows brilliance upon himself.</p>
<h4 id="04-38">04</h4>
<p>With the wooden sword he digs up the altar, with the axle of a chariot he measures. He sets up the sacrificial post; verily gathering together a threefold bolt he hurls it at his foe, to lay him low. If he were to set it up within the altar, he would win the world of the gods; if outside the altar, the world<br>
of men; he sets it up in the place where the altar and the edge (outside) meet, for the winning of both worlds. He should set (the set) up with the lower parts alike for one who desires the world of the Pitrs, with the girdle part alike for one who desires the world of men, with the top pieces alike for one who desires power, and all alike for one who desires support; the three in the middle alike for one who desires cattle; for through them [1] cattle attend (on him); verily he becomes possessed of cattle. He should interlock the others; verily he interlocks him with offspring and cattle. If he desire of a man, &lsquo;May he be liable to die&rsquo;, he should set it up for him in grave fashion, the northern half the higher, then (the southern) the lower; this is the grave fashion; he for whom he sets it up thus swiftly dies. For him who desires the heaven he should set it up with the southern half the higher, then the (northern) half the lower; verily the sacrificer makes it a ladder and a bridge to attain the world of heaven [2]. In that on one post he twines round two girdles, therefore one man wins two wives; in that he does not wind one girdle round two posts, therefore one wife does not find two husbands. If he desire of a man, &lsquo;Be a girl born to him&rsquo;, he should intertwine (the girdles) near the ends; verily a girl is born to him; if he desire of a man, &lsquo;Be a son born to him&rsquo;, he should cover it round right up to the end; verily a son is born to him [3]. The Asuras drove the gods to the south, the gods repelled them by the Upaśaya (post); that is why the Upaśaya has its name. In that the Upaśaya lies near (upaśáye) on the south, (it serves) to drive away the foe. All the other posts have victims (attached), the Upaśaya has none, its victim is the sacrificer; if he were not to indicate (a victim), the sacrificer would be ruined. &lsquo;N.N. is thy victim&rsquo;, (with these words) he should indicate whomsoever he hates; whom he hates [4], him he indicates as a victim to it. If he hates not, &lsquo;The mole is thy victim&rsquo;, he should say; he harms not domestic nor wild animals. Prajapati created offspring; he was destitute of proper food, he saw this set of eleven, and therewith he won proper food. In that there are ten posts, the Viraj has ten syllables, and the Viraj is food, he wins proper food by the Viraj [5]; thereby he milks the eleventh breast of her. In that the set of eleven (is set up), a thunderbolt is set up; it is liable to crush the sacrifice face to face; in that he sets up (the stake) (for Tvastr) with the wives, (it serves) to establish the sacrifice and to bind.</p>
<h4 id="05-38">05</h4>
<p>Prajapati created offspring; he thought himself emptied, he saw this set of eleven (victims), with it he bestowed life, power, and strength upon himself; he who sacrifices creates as it were offspring; then he is as it were emptied; in that this set of eleven is (offered), with it the sacrificer bestows life, power, and strength upon himself. With (the victim) for Agni he scatters, with that for Sarasvati he makes a pairing, with that for Soma he impregnates seed [1], with that for Pusan he propagates. There is one for Brhaspati; Brhaspati is the holy power (Brahman) of the gods; verily with the holy power (Brahman) he produces offspring for him. There is one for the All-gods; offspring are connected with the All-gods; verily he produces offspring, for him. By that for Indra he wins power, by that for the Maruts the people, by that for Indra and Agni force and might. That for Savitr is for</p>
<p>instigation, that for Varuna to free oneself from Varuna&rsquo;s (noose). In the middle he offers that for Indra; verily in the middle he bestows power on the sacrificer [2]. In front of that for Indra he offers that for the All-gods; food is connected with the All-gods; verily he puts food in front; therefore food is eaten in front. Having offered that for Indra he offers that for the Maruts; the Maruts are the people; verily he fastens the people to him. If he desire, &lsquo;May he who has attained (power) be banished; may he who is banished return (to power)&rsquo;, in the place of that for Indra he should offer that for Varuna, in the place of that for Varuna that for Indra [3]. He who has attained (power) is banished, he who is banished returns (to power). If he desire, &lsquo;May the people fall into confusion&rsquo;, he should interchange the animals; verily he causes the people to fall into confusion. If he should offer that to Varuna along the stream of the waters, Varuna would seize his offspring; he offers (the victim) facing north on the south side against the stream of the waters, to prevent Varuna seizing his offspring.</p>
<h4 id="06-38">06</h4>
<p>Indra caused Manu to sacrifice with his wife; after she had been encircled with fire he let her go; therewith Manu prospered; in that he lets go (the victim), (for Tvastr with the wives, the sacrificer prospers with the prosperity with which Manu prospered. From what is unsupported in the sacrifice the sacrifice comes to ruin; as the sacrifice comes to ruin the sacrificer comes to ruin along with it; in that he completes (the offering) (for Tvastr) with the wives with butter, (it serves) to support the sacrifice, and as the sacrifice finds support, the sacrificer finds support along with it. The offering of the caul [1] has been performed, the offering of the cow is not yet over, then he performs (the offering) (for Tvastr) with the wives; verily he performs it at the right moment; then indeed comes the conclusion. It is for Tvastr; Tvastr of the seed that is spilt moulds forms, him he sets loose as a male among wives; he for him moulds forms.</p>
<h4 id="07-37">07</h4>
<p>They kill the Soma in that they press it; in that there is (an oblation) of Soma, that is as when they slay for the dead a barren cow. If he were to offer in the northern half or the middle, he would cause conflict with the gods; he offers on the southern half; this is the quarter of the Pitrs; verily in their own quarter he propitiates the Pitrs. They give to the Udgatrs, (the oblation) of Soma has the Saman for its deity; whatever of the Saman they do amiss, that is the atonement for it. They look at [1] (the victim) for Soma is a purifier; verily they purify themselves. He who cannot see himself would be dead. Having made it full all round, he should look at (it), for in it he sees himself; verily also he purifies himself. He whose mind is gone should look at (it), (saying), &lsquo;That mind of mine which hath gone away, or which hath gone elsewhere, by means of King Soma, we keep within us&rsquo;; verily he keeps his mind in himself [2], his mind is not gone. At the third pressing the sacrifice departs from him who has sacrificed to him who has not sacrificed; he offers ghee with a verse to Agni and Visnu; all the deities are Agni, the sacrifice is Visnu; verily he supports the deities and the sacrifice. He sacrifices muttering, for pairing. The theologians say, &lsquo;Mitra appropriates the well-performed part of the sacrifice, Varuna the ill-performed; where then is the sacrifice, and where the sacrificer?; In that he offers a cow to Mitra and Varuna, by Mitra [3] he propitiates the well-performed part of the sacrifice, by Varuna the ill-performed; the sacrificer is not ruined. Even as men plough the field with the plough, so do the Rc and the Saman plough the sacrifice; in that he offers a cow to Mitra and Varuna, verily he rolls a roller over the ploughed-up sacrifice, for atonement. The metres of him who has sacrificed are worn out, the cow is the sap of the metres; in that he offers the cow to Mitra and Varuna, he again delights the metres, to drive away weariness; verily also he bestows sap upon the metres.</p>
<h4 id="08-36">08</h4>
<p>The gods divided up power and strength; what there was left over became the Atigrahya cups, and that is why the Atigrahyas have their name. In that the Atigrahyas are drawn, verily thus the sacrificer bestows. upon himself power and strength, brilliance by that for Agni, power by that for</p>
<p>Indra, splendour by that for Surya. The Atigrahyas are the support of the sacrifice, the Prsthas are the two wheels, if he were not to. draw them in the Prsthya (rite), the Prsthas would destroy the sacrifice in front; if he were to draw them in the Ukthya [1], the Atigrahyas would destroy the sacrifice behind; but they should be drawn in the Viśvajit with all the Prsthas, so that the sacrifice may have all its strength. Prajapati indicated the sacrifices to the gods, he put away their dear forms, they became the Atigrahya; &lsquo;Bodiless is his sacrifice&rsquo;, they say, &lsquo;for whom the Atigrahyas are not drawn.&rsquo; They should be drawn also in the Agnistoma, so that the sacrifice may have its body. All the deities were alike, and were not discriminated; these gods [2] saw these cups and drew them, Agni that for Agni, Indra that for Indra, Surya that for Surya; then indeed were they discriminated from the other gods; he, for whom knowing thus these cups are drawn, is discriminated from his evil foe. &lsquo;These worlds must be made full of light, with like strength&rsquo;, they say; verily with that for Agni he bestows light on this world, with that for Indra on the atmosphere, for Indra and Vayu are yoke fellows; with that for Surya on yonder world [3] he bestows light; full of light these worlds become for him; he makes them of like strength. Bamba and Viśvavayasa found these cups, and to them these worlds, the distant and the near, became revealed; to him, for whom knowing thus these cups are drawn, these worlds, the distant and the near, become revealed.</p>
<h4 id="09-37">09</h4>
<p>Whatever the gods did at the sacrifice the Asuras did. The gods caused the metres and the pressings to find support in the Adabhya; then the gods prospered, the Asuras were defeated; he, for whom knowing thus the Adabhya is drawn, prospers himself, his foe is defeated. Because the gods deceived the Asuras with the Adabhya (undeceivable), that is why the Adabhya has its name. He who knows thus deceives his foe; his foe deceives him not [1]. The Adabhya is the form of Prajapati, called the freer; he draws from (the Soma) which is tied up, for freedom; he who knows thus is set free from his evil foe. They kill the Soma in that they press it; in the slaying of the Soma the sacrifice is slain, with the sacrifice the sacrificer. The theologians say, &lsquo;What is it that the sacrificer does in the sacrifice whereby he goes alive to the world of heaven?&rsquo; The Adabhya is the taking alive; he draws from (the Soma) before pressing; verily he makes him go alive to the world of heaven. Now they break the sacrifice asunder when they make it find support in the Adabhya; he lets go the shoots, for the continuance of the sacrifice.</p>
<h4 id="10-36">10</h4>
<p>The gods drew the cups in a line; Prajapati saw this Anśu, drew it, and therewith prospered. Verily he, for whom knowing thus the Anśu is drawn, prospers. He draws from (the Soma) when it has been once pressed, for once he prospered thereby. He draws with the mind, for Prajapati is mind as it were; (verily it serves) to obtain Prajapati. He draws with (a vessel) of Udumbara; the Udumbara is strength; verily he wins strength; it has four corners; verily he finds support in the quarters [1]. He who knows the foundation of the Anśu becomes possessed of a foundation. The Saman is that called the Vamadevya; singing in his mind that foundation he draws; verily he becomes possessed of a foundation. If the Adhvaryu were not to make a success of drawing the Anśu, for both the Adhvaryu and the sacrificer would it go ill; if he were to make a success, for both would it go well; he draws without breathing; this is its success. He breathes over gold; gold is immortality, breath is life; verily with life he quickens immortality; it is of a hundred (Krsnalas) in weight, man has a hundred (years of) life, a hundred powers; verily in life, in power he finds support.</p>
<h4 id="11-36">11</h4>
<p>Prajapati assigned the sacrifices to the gods; he thought himself emptied; he pressed over himself the power and strength of the sacrifice in sixteen ways; that became the Sodaśin; there is no sacrifice called Sodaśin; in that there is a sixteenth Stotra and a sixteenth Çastra, therefore is it the Sodaśin, and that is why the Sodaśin has its name. In that the Sodaśin is drawn, so the sacrificer bestows power and strength upon himself. To the gods the world of heaven [1] did not become manifest; they saw this Sodaśin, and drew it; then did the world of heaven become manifest to</p>
<p>them; in that the Sodaśin is drawn, (it serves) for the conquest of the world of heaven. Indra was the youngest of the gods, he had recourse to Prajapati, he bestowed on him the Sodaśin, he drew it; then indeed did he attain the summit of the gods; he for whom knowing thus the Sodaśin [2] is drawn attains the summit of his equals. He draws at the morning pressing; the Sodaśin is the thunderbolt, the morning pressing is the thunderbolt; verily he draws it from its own birthplace. At each pressing he draws; verily from each pressing he produces it. At the third pressing he should draw (it) for one who desires cattle; the Sodaśin is the thunderbolt, the third pressing is cattle; verily by means of the thunderbolt he wins for him cattle from the third pressing. He should not draw (it) in the Ukthya; the Ukthas are offspring and cattle; if he were to draw (it) in the Ukthya [3], he would consume his offspring and cattle. He should draw (it) for one who desires cattle in the Atiratra; the Sodaśin is the thunderbolt; verily having won cattle for him by the thunderbolt, he calms them later with (the Çastras of) the night. He should also draw (it) in the Agnistoma for a Rajanya, for a Rajanya sacrifices desiring distinction; verily in the day rite he grasps a bolt for him, and the bolt kindles him to prosperity, or it burns him; the twenty-onefold is the Stotra used, for support; what is recited has the word &lsquo;bay&rsquo; in it; he obtains the dear abode of Indra [4]. The smaller metres were among the gods, the larger among the Asuras; the gods recited the larger metre with the smaller on either side; then indeed did they appropriate the world of the Asuras. In that he recites the larger metre with a smaller metre on either side, verily thus he appropriates the world of his foe. They make six syllables redundant; the seasons are six; verily he delights the seasons. They place four in front [5]; verily he wins four-footed cattle; two last; verily he wins two-footed (cattle); they make up an Anustubh; the Anustubh is speech, therefore speech is the highest of the breaths. When the sun is half-set, he sets about the Stotra of the Sodaśin; in this world Indra slew Vrtra; verily straightway be hurls the bolt against his foe. The sacrificial fee is a reddish-brown horse; that is the form of the bolt; (verily it serves) for success.</p>

<h3 id="i-the-one-day-sacrifices">I The One Day Sacrifices</h3>
<h4 id="01-37">01</h4>
<p>Production of offspring is light. Agni is the light of the gods; the Viraj is the light of the metres. The Viraj of speech ends in Agni; it is produced according to the Viraj. Therefore it is called light. Two Stomas bear the morning pressing, like expiration and inspiration; two the midday pressing, like eye and ear; two the third pressing, like speech and support. This sacrifice is commensurate with man, and is perfect [1]. Whatever desire a man has, he wins by it, for one wins all by that which is perfect. By means of the Agnistoma Prajapati created off spring; by means of the Agnistoma he grasped them. When he grasped them the mule escaped. Following it he took its seed, and placed it in the ass. Therefore the ass has double seed. They also say, &lsquo;He placed it in the mare.&rsquo; Therefore the mare has double seed. They also say, &lsquo;In the plants [2] he placed it.&rsquo; Therefore plants, though not anointed, glisten.&rsquo; They also say, &lsquo;He placed it in offspring.&rsquo; Therefore twins are born. Therefore the mule has no offspring, for his seed has been taken from him. Therefore he is not suitable for the sacrifice, but is suitable if there is a sacrifice when one gives (to the priests) all one&rsquo;s goods or a thousand, for he escaped. He who knowing thus sacrifices with the Agnistoma begets unborn offspring and grasps those that are born. Therefore they say, &lsquo;It is the best of sacrifices [3].&rsquo; Prajapati indeed is the best, for he sacrificed with it first. Prajapati desired, &lsquo;May I have offspring.&rsquo; He meted out the Trivrt from his mouth. After it the god Agni was created, the Gayatri metre, the Rathantara Saman, of men the Brahman, of cattle the goat; therefore are they the chief, for they were produced from the mouth. From the breast and arms he meted out the Pañcadaśa Stoma. After it the god Indra was created, the Tristubh metre, the Brhat [4] Saman, of men the Rajanya, of cattle the sheep. There fore they are strong, for they were created from strength. From the middle he meted out the Saptadaśa Stoma. After it the All-gods as deities were created, the Jagati metre, the Vairupa Saman, of men the Vaiśya, of cattle cows. Therefore are they to be eaten, for they were created from the receptacle of food. Therefore are they more numerous than others, for they were created after the most numerous of the gods. From his feet he meted out the Ekavinśa Stoma. After it the Anustubh metre [5] was created, the Vairaja Saman, of men the Çudra, of cattle the horse. Therefore the two, the horse and the Çudra, are dependent on others. Therefore the Çudra is not fit for the sacrifice, for he was not created after any gods. Therefore they depend on their feet, for they were created from the feet. The Trivrt is the breaths; the Pañcadaśa the half-months; the Saptadaśa Prajapati; these worlds are three; the Ekavinśa is the sun yonder. In this they rest, in this they find support. He who knows thus rests on this, finds, support in this.</p>
<h4 id="02-37">02</h4>
<p>At the morning pressing he keeps glorifying the Trivrt Stoma by the Gayatri metre; the Pañcadaśa Stoma by the Trivrt, which is splendour; the Saptadaśa by the Pañcadaśa which is force and strength; the Ekavinśa by the Saptadaśa which is connected with Prajapati and causes begetting. Verily thus Stoma glorifies Stoma; verily also Stoma leads Stoma forth. As many as are the Stomas, so many are desires, so many the worlds, so many the lights; verily so many Stomas, so many desires, so many worlds, so many lights does he win.</p>

<p>The theologians say, &lsquo;He indeed would really sacrifice, who having sacrificed with the Agnistoma should also sacrifice with the Sarvastoma.&rsquo; If they omit the Trivrt Stoma, then his vital airs are omitted, but he who offers the sacrifice does so with the wish, &lsquo;May it be in my vital airs. If they omit the Pañcadaśa Stoma, his strength is omitted, but he who offers the sacrifice does so with the wish, &lsquo;May it be in my strength.&rsquo; If they omit the Saptadaśa Stoma [1], his offspring is omitted, but he who offers the sacrifice does so with the wish, &lsquo;May it be in my offspring.&rsquo; If they omit the Ekavinśa Stoma, his support is omitted, but he who offers the sacrifice does so with the wish, &lsquo;May it be in my support.&rsquo; If they omit the Trinava Stoma, his seasons and the strength of the Naksatras are omitted, but he who offers the sacrifice does so with the wish, &lsquo;May it be in my seasons and the strength of the Naksatras&rsquo; [2]. If they omit the Trayastrinśa Stoma, his deities are omitted, and he who offers the sacrifice does so with the wish, &lsquo;May it be in my deities.&rsquo; He who knows the lowest of the Stomas attaining the first place, obtains him self the first place. The Trivrt is the lowest of Stomas, the Trivrt occupies the first place. He who know thus obtains the first place.<br>
THE EXPOSITION OF THE SATTRAS<br>
The Ahina Sacrifices</p>
<h4 id="04-39">04</h4>
<p>The Angirases performed a sacrificial session. They went to the world of heaven. Of them Havismant and Haviskrt were left behind. They desired, &lsquo;May we two go to the world of heaven.&rsquo; They two saw this two-night rite, they grasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then they went to the world of heaven. He, who knowing thus offers the two-night sacrifice, goes to the world of heaven. They went with the first day and arrived with the second [1]. The first day is the Abhiplava, the second the complete (gati). The first day is the Jyotistoma form of the Agnistoma; with it he wins splendour. The second day is an Atiratra with all the Stomas, that he may obtain all and win all. On the first day the Saman is in the Gayatri (metre). The Gayatri is brilliance and splendour; verily he bestows brilliance and splendour on himself. On the second day (the Saman) is in the Tristubh metre. The Tristubh is force and strength; verily he bestows force and strength on himself. The Saman on the first day [2] is the Rathantara. The Rathantara is this (earth); verily he stands firm on this (earth). (The Saman) on the second is the Brhat. The Brhat is yonder (sky); verily he stands firm on yonder (sky). They say, &lsquo;Where are the Jagati and the Anustubh?&rsquo; On the first day the Saman is that of Vikhanas; verily he does not leave the Jagati. On the second it is the Sodaśin; verily he does not leave the Anustubh. Then they say, &lsquo;If the days fall in the same half month, then the strength of one day only will belong to the rite.&rsquo; The first day takes place on the night of new moon; the second on the next day, verily the days fall on separate half-months, and have the several strengths. The first day has Havismant, the second Haviskrt in the finale, for support.</p>

<p>This was in the beginning the waters, the ocean. In it Prajapati becoming the wind moved. He saw her, and becoming a boar he seized her. Her, becoming Viśvakarma, he wiped. She extended, she became the earth, and hence the earth is called the earth (lit. &lsquo;the extended&rsquo;). In her Prajapati made effort. He produced the gods, Vasus, Rudras, and Adityas. The gods said to Prajapati, &lsquo;Let us have<br>
offspring.&rsquo; He said [1], &lsquo;As I have created you by penance, so seek ye offspring in penance.&rsquo; He gave to them Agni as a support, saying, &lsquo;Strive with that support.&rsquo; They strove with Agni as a support. After a year they produced one cow. They gave it to the Vasus, Rudras, and Adityas, saying &lsquo;Guard it.&rsquo; The Vasus, Rudras, and Adityas guarded it. It produced for the Vasus, Rudras, and Adityas (each) three hundred and thirty-three [2]. Thus she became the thousandth. The gods said to Prajapati, &lsquo;Cause sacrifice to be made to us with a thousand.&rsquo; He caused sacrifice to be made by the Vasus with the Agnistoma. They won this world and gave (the thousandth). He caused sacrifice to be made by the Rudras with the Ukthya. They won the atmosphere and gave (the thousand). He caused sacrifice to be made by the Adityas with the Atiratra. They won yonder world, and gave (the thousand). Now the atmosphere [3] was broken. Therefore the Rudras are murderous, for they have no support. Therefore they say, &lsquo;The midmost day of the three-day night is not fixed; for it was</p>
<p>moved.&rsquo; The Ajya (Çastra) of the midmost day is in the Tristubh metre. He recites the Samyana hymns, then recites the Sodaśin, that the day may be made firm and be not loose. Therefore in the three-night rite, the first day should be an Agnistoma, then an Ukthya, then an Atiratra, for the separation of these worlds. On each day in succession he gives three hundred continuously [4], for the continuance of these worlds. He should not break the decades lest he should thus destroy the Viraj. Now for the thousandth Indra and Visnu strove. Indra reflects, &lsquo;By this Visnu will appropriate all the thousand.&rsquo; They made arrangement as to it, Indra got two-thirds, Visnu the remaining third; verily the fact is recorded in the verse, &lsquo;Ye twain have conquered.&rsquo; It is the Achavaka [5] who recites this verse. Now (some say), &lsquo;The thousandth is to be given to the Hotr&rsquo;; what is left over, is left over for the Hotr; the Hotr is the receiver of what has not been taken. Then others say, &lsquo;It is to be given to the Unnetr.&rsquo; This is left over of the thousand, and the Unnetr is the one of the priests who is left over. Then some say, &lsquo;It is to be given to all those who have a place in the Sadas.&rsquo; Then some say, &lsquo;It should be driven away and allowed to wander at will.&rsquo; Then some say, &lsquo;It is to be given to the Brahman and the Agnidh [6], two shares to the Brahman and the third to the Agnidh. For the Brahman is connected with Indra, the Agnidh with Visnu; (verily the division is) just as they two agreed upon. Then some say, &lsquo;The one which is beautiful and of varied colour is the one to be given.&rsquo; Then others say, &lsquo;The one which has two colours and on either side is spotted is the one to be given&rsquo;, for the gaining of a thousand. That indeed is the march of the thousand (sahásrasyáyana). There are a thousand Stotriyas, a thousand gifts (to the priests); the world of heaven is measured by a thousand; (verily it serves) for the winning of the heavenly world.</p>
<h4 id="06-39">06</h4>
<p>Soma found a thousand; Indra discovered it after him. Yama approached them and said to them, &lsquo;May I have a share too in it.&rsquo; They said to him, &lsquo;Be it so.&rsquo; Yama saw in one of the (cows) strength. He said to them, &lsquo;This one has the strength of the thousand, this be mine, the rest yours.&rsquo; They said, &lsquo;We all see that in this one is strength [1]. Let us each have a portion.&rsquo; So they took shares in the one. They put her into the waters, saying, &lsquo;Come out for Soma.&rsquo; She came out in the shape of a red brown cow of one year old, together with three hundred and thirty three. Therefore let one buy the Soma with a red brown cow one year old. He, who knowing thus buys the Soma with a red brown cow one year old, buys the Soma with three hundred and thirty-three [2] and sacrifices with Soma for which he has paid a good price. They put her into the waters, saying, &lsquo;Come out for Indra.&rsquo; She came out in the shape of a red draught animal with good characteristics, destroying foes, together with three hundred and thirty-three. Therefore one should give a red draught animal with good characteristics, destroying foes. He who knowing thus gives a red draught animal with good characteristics, destroying foes, gives her as three hundred and thirty-three [3]. They put her into the waters&rsquo; saying, &lsquo;Come out for Yama.&rsquo; She came out in the shape of an aged, stupid, utterly bad animal, together with three hundred and thirty-three. Therefore one should offer as the funeral cow one that is aged, stupid, utterly bad. If a man knowing thus offers a cow that is aged, stupid, utterly bad, as the funeral cow, she becomes for him in yonder world three hundred and thirty-three. Speech is the thousandth. Therefore [4] a boon must be given; for she is a boon, and when she is given she is a thousand. Therefore one must not accept a boon; for she is a boon; verily he would be accepting a thousand. Let him say, &lsquo;She is a boon&rsquo;, and of another, &lsquo;Let this be mine&rsquo;; verily he avoids accepting a thousand. She should be spotted on either side. They say, &lsquo;Let her be spotted on one side only; spotted is the thousand on the other side.&rsquo; The one for a boon [5] should be beautiful, perfect in form; for she is a boon; (verily it serves for) prosperity. Leading her round to the north of the Agnidh&rsquo;s place he makes her smell the wooden tub near the Ahavaniya fire, saying,<br>
&lsquo;Smell the tub, O great one, with broad stream rich in milk;<br>
Let the drops enter thee as the streams the ocean;<br>
Give me a share in a thousand, with offspring, with cattle;<br>
Let wealth again visit me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Verily he unites him with offspring, with cattle, with wealth [6]. He becomes rich in offspring, in cattle, in wealth, who knows thus. Having gone round the Agnidh&rsquo;s place with her, he should offer in front, while the cow stands facing (him), Saying,<br>
Ye twain have conquered; ye are not conquered;<br>
Neither of the two of them hath been defeated;<br>
Indra and Visnu when ye contended,<br>
Ye did divide the thousand into three.&rsquo;<br>
The thousand is divided into three parts at the three-night festival; verily he makes her possessed of a thousand, he makes her the measure of a thousand [7]. He offers to her forms; verily he unites her with her forms. Rising up he mutters in her ear,<br>
&lsquo;O Ida, Ranti, Aditi, Sarasvati, Priya, Preyasi, Mahi, Viśruti,<br>
These, O inviolable one, are thy names;<br>
Proclaim me among the gods as a doer of good deeds.&rsquo;<br>
Verily she proclaims him among the gods, and the gods take note of him.</p>
<h4 id="07-38">07</h4>
<p>By the thousandth the sacrifice goes to the world of heaven. She makes him go to the world of heaven. &lsquo;Do thou make me go to the world of heaven&rsquo;, he says; verily she makes him go to the world of heaven. &lsquo;Do thou make me go to the world of light&rsquo;, he says; verily she makes him go to the world of light. &lsquo;Do thou make me go to all holy worlds&rsquo;, he says; verily she makes him go to all holy worlds [1]. &lsquo;Do thou make me go to a secure place, with offspring and cattle, let wealth again visit me&rsquo;, (he says); verily she establishes him with offspring and cattle in wealth. Rich in offspring, cattle, and wealth he becomes who knows thus. He should give her to the Agnidh, or the Brahman, or the Hotr or the Udgatr, or the Adhvaryu. In giving her, he gives a thousand. A thousand he accepts who not knowing [2] accepts her. He should accept her, (saying), &lsquo;Thou art one, not a thousand. Thee as one I accept, not a thousand; come to me as one, not as a thousand&rsquo;; verily he who knows thus accepts her as one, not as a thousand. &lsquo;Thou art gentle, resting well, auspicious; come to me as gentle, well resting, auspicious,&rsquo; [3] he says; verily she becoming gentle, well resting, auspicious, comes to him, and harms him not. The theologians say, &lsquo;Does the thousandth follow the thousand? or the thou sand the thousandth?&rsquo; If he were to let her go to the east, the thousandth would follow the thousand; now the thousand has no understanding, and would not recognize the world of heaven. He lets her go to the west; the thousand follow after her. She knowing goes to the world of heaven. He lets her go towards the sacrificer. Quickly a thousand springs up. The (thousandth) is the last to be taken, but the first to go to the gods.</p>

<p>Atri gave offspring to Aurva who was desirous of children. She deemed herself empty, without strength, weak, worn out. He saw the four night rite; he grasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then indeed were four sons born for him, a good Hotr, a good Udgatr, a good Adhvaryu, a good councillor. He, who knowing thus offers the four-night rite, has four sons born for him, a good Hotr, a good Udgatr, a good Adhvaryu, a good councillor. The Pavamana (Stomas) which are twenty-fourfold are splendour [1]; the increasing Stomas are prosperity. Atri who had faith as his deity and offered sacrifices was not visited by the four strengths, brilliance, power, splendour, food. He saw these four Soma libations with the four Stomas; he grasped them and sacrificed with them. He won brilliance with the first, power with the second, splendour with the third, food with the fourth. He, who knowing thus, grasps the four Soma libations with the four Stomas and sacrifices with them, wins brilliance with the first, power with the second, splendour with the third, food with the fourth. With the success which Atri had, the sacrificer prospers.</p>
<h4 id="09-38">09</h4>
<p>Jamadagni desiring prosperity, sacrificed with the four-night rite. He prospered therein, and accordingly the two descendants of Jamadagni are not seen as grey-haired. That prosperity is his who knowing thus offers the four-night rite. On the Upasads offerings of the sacrificial cake are made. The sacrificial cake is cattle; verily he wins cattle. The sacrificial cake is food; verily he wins food. An eater of food and owner of cattle he becomes who knowing thus offers the four-day rite.</p>
<h4 id="10-37">10</h4>
<p>The year was alone in the world. He desired, &lsquo;May I create the seasons.&rsquo; He saw this five-night rite; he grasped it and sacrificed with it. Then indeed he created the seasons. He who- knowing thus offers the five-night rite gains offspring. The seasons being created were not distinguished. They saw this five-night rite. They grasped it and sacrificed with it. Then they were distinguished [1]. He who knowing thus offers the five-night rite is distinguished from the enemy that hates him. Sarvaseni Çauceya desired, &lsquo;May I be rich in cattle.&rsquo; He grasped this five-night rite and sacrificed with it. Then indeed he obtained a thousand cattle. He who knowing thus offers the five-night rite obtains a thousand cattle. Babara Pravahani desired, &lsquo;May I be a speaker of speech.&rsquo; He grasped the five-night rite [2] and sacrificed with it. Then indeed he became a speaker of speech. He, who knowing thus offers the five-night rite, becomes a speaker of speech, and men call him &lsquo;lord of speech&rsquo;. The four-night rite is incomplete; the six-night rite is redundant, the correct sacrifice is the five-night rite. He who knowing thus sacrifices with the five-night rite sacrifices with the correct sacrifice. The (sacrifices) last five nights; the year consists of five seasons [3]; verily he stands firm in the year with its five seasons. Again the Pankti has five elements, the sacrifice is fivefold; verily he wins the sacrifice. There is an Agnistoma characterized by the Trivrt (Stoma); verily he wins brilliance. There is a Pañcadaśa (Stoma); verily he wins power. There is a Saptadaśa (Stoma), for the obtainment of food; verily also he gains offspring by reason of it. There is an Agnistoma with the Pañcadaśa (Stoma), for the gaining of Prajapati; (it has) the characteristics of the Mahavrata, for the gaining of food. There is a Viśvajit Atiratra, with all the Prstha (Stotras), for the winning of all.<br>

<p>The Sadhya gods, desirous of heaven, saw this (rite) of six nights. They grasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then indeed did they go to the world of heaven. Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite) of six nights, go to the world of heaven. (The rite) of six nights is a Sattra of the gods, for these Prsthas are obvious. Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite) of six nights, mount evidently upon the gods. (The rite) is of six nights; the seasons are six, the Prsthas are six [1]; verily by the Prsthas they mount the seasons, by the seasons the year; verily in the year they find support. They</p>
<p>proceed with the Brhat and the Rathantara, (Samans). The Rathantara, is this (earth), the Brhat is yonder (sky); verily with them do they proceed; verily also in them do they find support. These indeed are the quick paths of the sacrifice; verily by them do they proceed to the world of heaven. There is an Agnistoma with the Trivrt (Stoma); verily they win brilliance. There is a Pañcadaśa (Stoma); verily they win power. There is a Saptadaśa (Stoma) [2], for the winning of food; verily also by it they are propagated. There is an Ekavinśa (Stoma), for support; verily also they place radiance in themselves. There is a Trinava (Stoma), for con quest. There is a Trayastrinśa (Stoma), for support. They should sacrifice with this (rite) of six nights with both Sadas and oblation-holder. The oblation-holder and the Agnidh&rsquo;s seat should be of Aśvattha wood, for that is heavenly. They should have wheels, for gaining the world of heaven. The sacrificial post is mortar-based, for support. They go forward, for forward as it were is the world of heaven [3]. They go with the Sarasvati. This is the path that goes to the gods; verily they mount upon it. They go calling aloud; verily fastening misfortune on another they attain support. When ten (cows) make a hundred, then is one time to stop. Man is of a hundred (years of) life and of a hundred powers; verily in life and power do they find support. When a hundred make a thousand, then is one time to stop. Yonder world is measured by a thousand; verily they conquer yonder world. If one of them perish or they be oppressed, then is one time to stop, for that is a suitable opportunity.</p>

(The rite) is of seven nights; the domesticated animals are seven, the wild seven, the metres seven, for winning both. There is an Agnistoma with the Trivrt (Stoma); verily he wins brilliance [1]. There is a Pañcadaśa (Stoma); verily he wins power. There is a Saptadaśa (Stoma), for the winning of food; verily also by it he is propagated. There is an Ekavinśa (Stoma), for support; verily he places radiance in himself. There is a Trinava (Stoma), for conquest. There is an Agnistoma with the Pañcadaśa (Stoma) to obtain Prajapati; it has (the characteristics of) the Mahavrata, to win food. There is a Viśvajit Atiratra with all the Prsthas, to conquer all. If they were in the preceding days to perform the Prsthas in the obvious way, and similarly in the Viśvajit [2], the last day would be as when one sits down to a cow which has already been milked; it would not be good enough for even a single night (rite). In the preceding days they perform the Brhat and the Rathantara. The Rathantara is this (earth), the Brhat yonder (sky); verily they depart not from them; verily also in them do they find support. In that they perform the Prsthas in the Viśvajit in the obvious manner, it is as when one milks a cow which is ready to give.</p>

<p>Brhaspati desired, &lsquo;May I be resplendent.&rsquo; He saw this rite of eight nights, he grasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then indeed did he become resplendent. He, who knowing thus sacrifices with (the rite) of eight nights, becomes resplendent. (The rite) is of eight nights; the quarters are four, the intermediate quarters four; verily from the quarters he wins splendour [1]. There is an Agnistoma with the Trivrt (Stoma); verily he wins brilliance. There is a Pañcadaśa (Stoma); verily he wins power.

There is an Agnistoma with the Pañcadaśa (Stoma), to obtain Prajapati; it has (the characteristics of) the Mahavrata, to win food. There is a Viśvajit Atiratra with all the Prsthas, to conquer all.</p>
<h4 id="04-40">04</h4>
<p>Prajapati created offspring. They being created were ahungered. He saw this (rite) of nine nights, he grasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then indeed was he able to help offspring, When offspring are ahungered, one should sacrifice with (the rite) of nine nights, for these worlds are not fitted for</p>
<h4 id="05-40">05</h4>
<p>Prajapati desired, &lsquo;May I be propagated.&rsquo; He saw this Daśahotr, and offered it. By this he created (the rite) of ten nights, and by this (rite) often nights he was propagated. If one is about to consecrate oneself for (the rite) of ten nights one should offer the Daśahotr; verily he creates by the Daśahotr (the rite) of ten nights, and by (the rite) of ten nights he is propagated. The sacrifice of ten nights is connected with the Viraj. He, who knowing thus sacrifices with (the rite) of ten nights, attains the Viraj. The sacrifice of ten nights is connected with Prajapati [1]. He, who knowing thus sacrifices with (the rite) of ten nights, is propagated. Indra was on a level with the gods, he was not separated from them. He ran up to Prajapati; he gave him this (rite) of ten nights. He grasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then indeed he became separated from the other gods. He, who knowing thus sacrifices with (the rite) of ten nights, attains separation from the evil enemy. The sacrifice of ten nights has three eminences [2]; the Pañcadaśa (Stoma) is one eminence; the Ekavinśa one eminence, the Trayastrinśa one eminence. He, who knowing thus sacrifices with (the rite) of ten nights, becomes thrice eminent among his peers. The sacrificer is the Pañcadaśa; the sacrificer the Ekavimśa, the sacrificer the Trayastrinśa, and the others are the citadels. If a man have witchcraft practised against him, he should sacrifice with (the rite) of ten nights; verily he surrounds himself with the divine citadels; no harm whatever can befall him, the practiser of witchcraft overcomes him not. The gods and the Asuras were in conflict. The gods [3] saw in (the rite) of ten nights the divine citadels. They surrounded themselves with them; no harm whatever befell them; then the gods prospered, the Asuras were defeated. He who has enemies should sacrifice with (the rite) of ten nights; verily he surrounds himself with the divine citadels; no harm whatever befalls him; he prospers and his enemy is defeated. Stoma serves Stoma; verily he makes his enemy his servant. In that they perform the lesser Stoma after per forming the greater there is uniformity [4]; to break the uniformity the Agnistoma Samans are before and after (the greater Stoma). There is an Agnistoma, with the Trivrt (Stoma), in praise of Agni, with verses addressed to Agni; verily he wins brilliance. There is an Ukthya, with the Pañcadaśa (Stoma), and verses addressed to Indra; verily he wins power. There is an Agnistoma, with the Trivrt (Stoma), and verses addressed to the All-gods; verily he wins prosperity. There is an Agni stoma, with the Saptadaśa (Stoma), and verses addressed to Prajapati, in which the Soma offering is bitter, to win food; verily also by it he is propagated [5]. There is an Ukthya with the Ekavinśa (Stoma), and verses addressed to the sun, for support; verily he places radiance in himself. There is an Agnistoma, with the Saptadaśa (Stoma), and verses addressed to Prajapati, (called) the added oblation; verily he is invited by all. There are two Agnistomas, with the Trinava (Stoma) on either side (of the Ukthya), with verses addressed to Indra, for conquest. There is an Ukthya, with the Trayastrinśa (Stoma) with verses addressed to the All-gods, for rest. There is an Atiratra Viśvajit with all the Prsthas, for supremacy.</p>

<p>The seasons, desirous of offspring, could not procure offspring. They desired, &lsquo;May we create offspring, may we win offspring, may we procure offspring, may we possess offspring.&rsquo; They saw this (rite) of eleven nights; they grasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then indeed did they create offspring, win offspring, procure offspring, and possess offspring. They became the seasons, and that is why the seasonal periods are seasonal periods. They are the children of the seasons, and</p>
<p>therefore [1] they are said to be connected with the seasons. Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite) of eleven nights, create offspring, win offspring, procure offspring, and possess offspring. There is an Atiratra with the form of light; verily they place light before them, to reveal the world of heaven. There is a Prsthva Sadaha; the seasons are six, the Prsthas are six; verily by the Prsthas they mount upon the seasons, by the seasons upon the year; verily in the year they find support. There is a Caturvinśa; the Gayatri has twenty-four syllables [2], splendour is connected with the Gayatri; verily in the Gayatri and in splendour they find support. There is a Catucśatvarinśa; the Tristubh has forty-four syllables, the Tristubh is power; verily in the Tristubh and in power they find support. There is an Astacatvarinśa; the Jagati has forty-eight syllables, cattle are connected with the Jagati; verily in the Jagati and in cattle they find support. (The rite) is of eleven nights, the seasons are five, the seasonal periods are five; verily in the seasons, in the seasonal periods, and in the year they find support and win offspring. There are Atiratras on either side, to secure offspring.</p>

<p>He should draw the cup for Indra and Vayu first if he desire, &lsquo;May my offspring accord in order of seniority.&rsquo; Offspring are in accord according to the arrangement of the sacrifice, and if the sacrifice is disarranged, they are at discord. Verily he makes his offspring in accord in order of seniority; the<br>
younger does not overstep the older. He should draw the cup for Indra and Vayu first for one who is ill. For he who is ill is separated from breath, the cup for Indra and Vayu is breath; verily he unites him with breath. They should draw the cup for Mitra and Varuna first if when they are consecrated one die [1]. From expiration and inspiration are they separated of whom when consecrated one dies, Mitra and Varuna are expiration and inspiration; verily at the commencement they grasp expiration and inspiration. He should draw the Aśvina cup first who is infirm. The Aśvins are of the gods those who are infirm, late as it were came they to the front. The Aśvins are the gods of him who is infirm; they lead him to the front. He who desires support having attained prosperity should draw the Çukra Cup first. The Çukra is yonder sun, this is the end; a man when he has reached the end [2] of prosperity stops; verily from the end he grasps the end, and becomes not worse. He who practises witchcraft should draw the Manthin cup first. The Manthin vessel is a vessel of misfortune; verily he causes death to seize on him; swiftly does he reach misfortune. He should draw the Agrayana cup first whose father and grandfather are holy, and who yet does not possess holiness. From speech and power is he separated whose father and grandfather are holy [3], and who yet does not possess holiness. The Agrayana (cup) is the breast as it were and the speech as it were of the sacrifice; verily with speech and with power he unites him, then he becomes not worse. He against whom witchcraft is practised should draw the Ukthya cup first. The Ukthya vessel is the power of all vessels; verily he yokes him with all power. He should take as Puroruc (the verse) &lsquo;O Sarasvati, lead us to prosperity.&rsquo; Sarasvati is speech [4]; verily with speech he yokes him. &lsquo;May we go not through thee to joyless fields&rsquo;, he says. The joyless fields are those of death; verily he goes not to the fields of death. He should draw full cups for one who is ill. Pain afflicts the breaths of him who is ill, the cups are breaths; verily he frees his breaths from pain, and even if his life is gone, yet he lives. He should draw full cups if rain does not fall. Pain afflicts the breaths of the people if rain does not fall, the cups are breaths; verily he frees the breaths of the people from pain, and rain soon falls.</p>

<p>(The cup) for Indra and Vayu is connected with the Gayatri, the opening day is connected with the Gayatri, and therefore on the opening day (the cup) for Indra and Vayu is drawn; verily he draws it in its own abode. The Çukra is connected with the Tristubh, the second day is connected with the Tristubh, and therefore on the second day the Çukra is drawn; verily he draws it in its own abode. The Agrayana is connected with the Jagati, the third day is connected with the Jagati, and therefore on the third day the Agrayana is drawn; verily he draws it in its own abode. In that it completes the metres, it completes the sacrifice [1]; in that the Agrayana is drawn on the next day, where they have seen the sacrifice, thence does he again employ it. The second three nights begin with the Jagati, the Agrayana is connected with the Jagati; in that the Agrayana is drawn on the fourth day, he draws it in its own abode; verily also they revolve round their own metre. (The cup) for Indra</p>
<p>and Vayu is connected with the Rathantara (Saman), the fifth day is connected with the Rathantara, and therefore on the fifth day [2] (the cup) for Indra and Vayu is drawn; verily he draws it in its own abode. The Çukra is connected with the Brhati, the sixth day is connected with the Brhati, and therefore on the sixth day the Çukra is drawn; verily he draws it in its own abode. In that it completes the metres, it completes for the second time the sacrifice; in that the Çukra is drawn on the next day, where they have seen the sacrifice, thence does he again employ it. The third three nights begin with the Tristubh, the Çukra is connected with the Tristubh [3]; in that the Çukra is drawn on its seventh day, he draws it in its own abode, and they revolve round their own metre. The Agrayana, is speech, the eighth day is speech, and therefore on the eighth day the Agrayana is drawn; verily he draws it in its own abode. (The cup) for Indra and Vayu is breath, the ninth day is breath, and therefore on the ninth day (the cup) for Indra and Vayu. is drawn; verily he draws it in its own abode. In that [4] it completes the metres, it completes for the third time the sacrifice; in that (the cup) for Indra and Vayu is drawn on the next day, where they have seen the sacrifice, thence does he again employ it, and they revolve round their own metre. They go by a trackless way leaving the path who start with anything except (the cup) for Indra and Vayu. The tenth day is the end of the sacrifice, (the cup) for Indra and Vayu is drawn on the tenth day; verily having reached the end of the sacrifice [5], they proceed from the trackless way to the path, and it is as when men go pushing on with a strong (team). The metres set their wishes on one another&rsquo;s world, and the gods then interchanged them. The fourth day is the abode of (the cup) for Indra and Vayu, the Agrayana is drawn on this (day); therefore (the cup) for Indra and Vayu is drawn on the ninth day, the abode of the Agrayana. The fifth day is the abode of the Çukra [6], (the cup) for Indra and Vayu is drawn on this (day); therefore the Çukra is drawn on the seventh day, the abode of (the cup) for Indra and Vayu. The sixth day is the abode of the Agrayana, the Çukra is drawn on this (day); therefore the Agrayana is drawn on the eighth day, the abode of the Çukra. Verily thus does he exchange the metres, and he who knows thus obtains interchange with the richer; verily also he causes concord in the sacrifice for the gods. Therefore one gives this to another.</p>

<p>Prajapati desired, &lsquo;May I be propagated.&rsquo; He saw this (rite) of twelve nights; he grasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then indeed was he propagated. He who desires, &lsquo;May I be propagated&rsquo;, should sacrifice with (the rite) of twelve nights; verily he is propagated. The theologians say, &lsquo;The sacrifices have Agnistomas at the beginning; why then is Atiratra first employed?&rsquo; The two Atiratras are the eyes of the sacrifice, the two Agnistomas the pupils; if [1] they were to employ the Agnistoma first, they would put the pupils outside; therefore the Atiratra is employed first; verily having inserted the eyes of the sacrifice they put the pupils in them. He, who knows the Gayatri to have sides of light, goes to the world of heaven with light and radiance. The sides are the Agnistomas, the eight Ukthyas in between are the body; verily the Gayatri has sides of light. He who knows thus goes to the world of heaven with light and radiance [2]. The twelve nights&rsquo; (rite) is Prajapati in twelve divisions. The two sides are the Atiratras, the eight Ukthyas within are the body; Prajapati in such guise touches truth with the Sattra, truth is the breaths; verily he touches the breaths. Those who perform the Sattra perform it with the breath of all people, and therefore they ask, &lsquo;Are these performers of a Sattra?&rsquo; Dear to people and noble is he who knows thus.</p>
<h4 id="10-38">10</h4>
<p>This (rite) with a Vaiśvanara on one side (only) was not able to win the world of heaven; it was stretched upwards and the gods piled round this Vaiśvanara, to overcome the world of heaven. The seasons made Prajapati sacrifice with it, and in them because of it he prospered. He prospers among the priests who knowing thus sacrifices with (the rite) of twelve days. They were desirous of obtaining (their desires) from him. He gave to the spring the sap [1], to the hot season barley, to the rains plants, to autumn rice, beans and sesamum to winter and the cool season. Prajapati made Indra sacrifice with it. Then indeed did Indra become Indra; therefore they say, &lsquo;It is the sacrifice of the inferior&rsquo;, for he by it first sacrificed. He eats a corpse who accepts a present at a Sattra; a human corpse or the corpse of a horse. Food is the cow; in that he does not purify the vessel in which they</p>
<p>carry food, filth is produced from it [2]. One should sacrifice by oneself, for Prajapati prospered by himself. One should be consecrated for twelve nights; the year consists of twelve months, Prajapati is the year, he is Prajapati, he is born indeed who is born from fervour. The twelve Upasads are these four sets of three nights; with the first three he prepares the sacrifice, with the second three he grasps the sacrifice [3], with the third three he cleanses the vessels, and with the fourth three he purifies himself within. He who eats his victim, eats his flesh, who eats his sacrificial cake, eats his brains, who eats his fried grain, eats his excrement, who eats his ghee, eats his marrow, who eats his Soma, eats his sweat, and also he eats the excrements from his head, who accepts (a present) at the twelve-day (rite). Therefore one should not cause one to sacrifice with the twelve-day (rite), to avert evil.<br>

<p>They go swiftly in that it is the tenth day. In that it is the tenth day they loosen their sins. He who among men going swiftly falls in with a trackless way, he who strikes a post, and he who stumbles, are left out. So he, who on this tenth day, the Avivakya, comes to grief, is left out. If one points out (an error) to one who comes to grief, he seizes hold of him and comes out successfully, and then the one who pointed out (his error) is left out [1]. Therefore on the tenth day, the Avivakya, one should not point out (errors) to one who comes to grief. Or rather they say, &lsquo;By that which was successful in the sacrifice the gods went to the world of heaven, and overcame the Asuras by what was unsuccessful.&rsquo; What is successful in the sacrifice belongs to the sacrificer, what is unsuccessful to his enemy. Now he, who comes to grief on the tenth day, the Avivakya, produces overmuch. Those who are outside as spectators [2] should point out (his error). If there be none there, then (the error) should be pointed out from within the Sadas. If there be none there, then it should be pointed out by the Grhapati. At any rate it should be pointed out. They sing the verses of the serpent queen on that day. The queen of what creeps is this (earth). Whatever on this (earth) they praise, whatever they have praised, through that is this (earth) the serpent queen. Now whatever they have praised with speech and what they will praise thereafter, (it is done thinking), &lsquo;Having won both and obtained them, let us stop.&rsquo; They sing these (verses) with the mind. Neither a horse chariot nor a mule chariot can in one moment encompass this (earth), but mind can in one moment encompass it, mind can overcome it. Then they repeat the Brahman. The Rc verses are limited, the Samans are limited, and the Yajuses are limited, but of the Brahman there is no end, and that he should declare to the one who responds. That is the response.</p>

<p>The theologians say, &lsquo;By the first day of the twelve-day rite what is it that the sacrificer takes from the priests?&rsquo; &lsquo;Brilliance and power&rsquo; is (the answer). &lsquo;What by the second?&rsquo; &lsquo;The breaths and food.&rsquo; &lsquo;What by the third?&rsquo; &lsquo;These three worlds.&rsquo; &lsquo;What by the fourth?&rsquo; &lsquo;Four-footed cattle.&rsquo; &lsquo;What by the fifth?&rsquo; &lsquo;The Pankti with its elements.&rsquo; &lsquo;What by the sixth?&rsquo; &lsquo;The six seasons.&rsquo; &lsquo;What by the seventh?&rsquo; &lsquo;The Çakvari with its seven feet.&rsquo; &lsquo;What by the eighth?&rsquo; &lsquo;The Gayatri with its eight syllables.&rsquo; &lsquo;What by the ninth?&rsquo; &lsquo;The Trivrt Stoma.&rsquo; &lsquo;What by the tenth?&rsquo; &lsquo;The Viraj with its ten syllables.&rsquo; &lsquo;What by the eleventh?&rsquo; &lsquo;The Tristubh with its eleven syllables.&rsquo; &lsquo;What by the twelfth?&rsquo; &lsquo;The Jagati with its twelve syllables.&rsquo; So much is there as that. So much as that he takes from them.</p>

<p>(The rite) of thirteen nights is a complete (rite of) twelve days, for the opening and concluding days are the same. There are three Atiratras, three are these worlds, for the obtaining of these worlds. The first Atiratra is the expiration, the second cross-breathing, the third inspiration; verily they find support in expiration, inspiration, out-breathing, and food, and reach their full life, who knowing thus perform (the rite) of thirteen nights. They say, &lsquo;(The rite) of twelve days is the sequence of speech. They would cleave it if they put an Atiratra in the middle, and the speech of the householder would be liable to fail.&rsquo; They perform the Mahavrata after the Chandomas; verily they maintain the sequence of speech, and the speech of the householder is not likely to fail. The Chandomas are</p>
<p>cattle, the Mahavrata food; in that they perform the Mahavrata after the Chandomas, they find support in cattle and in food.</p>

<p>The Adityas desired, &lsquo;May we be prosperous in both worlds.&rsquo; They saw this (rite) of fourteen nights; they grasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then indeed they prospered in both worlds, this and yonder. Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite) of fourteen nights, prosper in both worlds, this and yonder. (The rite) is of fourteen nights, there are seven domesticated plants and seven wild; (verily it serves) to win both. In that the Prsthas are performed in succession [1], they conquer by them yonder world. In that the Prsthas are reversed, they conquer by them this world. There are two Trayastrinśa Stomas in the middle; verily they attain sovereignty. (These two) are overlords; verily they become overlords of their peers. There are Atiratras on either side, for security.</p>
<h4 id="05-41">05</h4>
<p>Prajapati went to the world of heaven. The gods followed him, and the Adityas and the cattle followed them. The gods said, &lsquo;The cattle on which we have lived have followed us.&rsquo; They arranged this (rite) of fourteen nights away for them. The Adityas mounted the world of heaven with the Prsthas; they arranged the cattle in this world with the two Tryahas. By means of the Prsthas the Adityas prospered in yonder world, the cattle in this world by the Tryahas [1]. Those who, knowing thus, perform (the rite of) fourteen nights, prosper in both worlds, in this and in yonder; by the Prsthas they prosper in yonder world and by the Tryahas in this world. The three days are the Jyotis, Go, and Ayus. The Jyotis is this (earth), the Go the atmosphere, the Ayus yonder (sky); verily they mount upon these worlds. If the Prsthas were on one side, there would be a lack of balance; the Prsthas are in the middle, for balance [2]. The Prsthas are force and strength; verily they place force and strength in the middle. They proceed with the Brhat and the Rathantara (Samans). The Rathantara is this (earth), the Brhat yonder (sky); verily with them do they proceed; verily also in them they find support. These indeed are the quick paths of the sacrifice; verily by them do they proceed to the world of heaven. They mount the world of heaven turning away (from earth), who perform the Prsthas in succession. The Tryaha is reversed, for the return (from heaven), and for support. Having prospered in either world they cease (the rite). The (nights) are fourteen. As for ten of them, the Viraj is ten-syllabled, the Viraj is food; verily by the Viraj they win food. As for four, the quarters are four; verily they find support in the quarters. There are Atiratras on either side, for security.</p>
<h4 id="06-41">06</h4>
<p>Indra was on a level with the gods, he was not distinguished from them. He ran up to Prajapati; he gave him this (rite) of fifteen nights. He grasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then indeed he became distinguished from the other gods. Those who knowing thus perform (the rite) of fifteen nights attain distinction from the evil enemy. The three days are Jyotis, Go, and Ayus. The Jyotis is this (earth), the Go the atmosphere [1], the Ayus yonder (sky); verily they find support in these worlds. There can be no Sattra where there is no Chandoma; in that there axe Chandomas, there is the Sattra. The gods they win by the Prsthas, the cattle by the Chandomas. The Prsthas are force and strength, the strength, and in cattle, they Chandomas cattle; verily in force and find support. (The rite) is of fifteen nights; the bolt is fifteenfold; verily they hurl the bolt at their enemies. There are Atiratras on either side, for securing power.</p>
<h4 id="07-40">07</h4>
<p>Indra was as it were loose and unfixed. He was afraid of the Asuras. He ran up to Prajapati; he gave him this (rite) of fifteen nights as a bolt. With it he overcame and conquered the Asuras and attained prosperity. By the Agnistut he burned away the evil, by (the rite) of fifteen nights he placed force, might, power, and strength in himself. Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite) of fifteen nights overcome and conquer their enemies and attain prosperity. By the Agnistut they burn away the evil</p>
<p>[1], by (the rite) of fifteen nights they place force, might, power, and strength in themselves. These (nights) are full of cattle. Fifteen indeed are the nights of the half-month, the year is made up of half-months, cattle are born throughout the year; therefore (these nights) are full of cattle. These (nights) are heavenly. Fifteen indeed are the nights of the half-month, the year is made up of half months, the world of heaven is the year; verily (these nights) are heavenly. There are the three days, Jyotis, Ayus, and Go. The Jyotis is this (earth), the Go the atmosphere [2], the Ayus yonder (sky); verily they mount upon these worlds. If the Prsthas were on one side, there would be a lack of balance; the Prsthas are in the middle, for balance. The Prsthas are force and strength; verily they place force and strength in the middle. They proceed with the Brhat and the Rathantara (Samans). The Rathantara is this (earth), the Brhat yonder (sky); verily with them do they proceed; verily also in them they find support. These indeed are the quick paths of the sacrifice; verily by them do they proceed to the world of heaven [3]. They mount the world of heaven turning away (from earth), who perform the Prsthas in succession. The Tryaha is reversed, for the return (from heaven), and for support. Having prospered in either world they cease (the rite). These (nights) are fifteen. As for ten of them, the Viraj is ten-syllabled, the Viraj is food; verily by the Viraj they win food. As for five, the quarters are five; verily they find support in the quarters. There are Atiratras on either side, for securing power, strength, offspring, and cattle.</p>
<h4 id="08-39">08</h4>
<p>Prajapati desired, &lsquo;May I be an eater of food.&rsquo; He saw this (rite of) seventeen nights; he grasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then indeed he became an eater of food. Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite) of seventeen nights, become eaters of food. There is a period of five days; the seasons are five in the year; verily in the seasons and the year they find sup port. Again the Pankti is of five elements, the sacrifice is fivefold; verily they win the sacrifice. There can be no Sattra where there is no Chandoma; in that there are Chandomas, there is the sacrifice. The gods they win by the Prsthas, the cattle by the Chandomas. The Prsthas are force and strength, the Chandomas cattle; verily in force and strength, and in cattle, they find support. (The rite is) of seventeen nights; Prajapati is seventeenfold; (verily it serves) to obtain Prajapati. There are Atiratras on either side, for securing food.</p>
<h4 id="09-40">09</h4>
<p>The Viraj dividing itself stayed among the gods with the holy power (Brahman), among the Asuras with food. The gods desired, &lsquo;May we acquire both the holy power (Brahman) and food! They saw (the rite of) these twenty nights. Then indeed they acquired both the holy power (Brahman) and food, and became resplendent and eaters of food. Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite of) these nights, acquire both the holy power (Brahman) and food [1], and become resplendent and eaters of food. They (make up) two Virajs; verily separately in them they find support. Man is twentyfold, ten fingers and ten toes; verily obtaining the greatness of man they cease (the rite). There are Tryahas consisting of Jyotis, Go, and Ayus. The Jyotis is this (earth), the Go the atmosphere, the Ayus yonder (sky); verily they mount upon these worlds. The Tryahas go in order; verily in order they mount the world of heaven [2]. If the Prsthas were on one side there would be a lack of balance; the Prsthas are in the middle, for balance. The Prsthas are force and strength; verily they place force and strength in the middle. They proceed with the Brhat and the Rathantara (Samans). The Rathantara is this (earth), the Brhat yonder (sky); verily with them do they proceed, verily also in them they find support. These indeed are the quick paths of the sacrifice; verily by them do they proceed to the world of heaven. They mount the world of heaven turning away (from earth), who perform the Prsthas in succession. The Tryaha is re versed, for the return (from heaven), and for support. Having prospered in either world they cease (the rite). There are Atiratras on either side, for securing splendour and food.</p>
<h4 id="10-39">10</h4>
<p>Yonder sun was in this world. The gods surrounded it with the Prsthas and removed it to the world of heaven. They surrounded it from below with the Para (Samans), and placed it with the Divakirtya (Saman) in the world of heaven. They surrounded it from above with the Para (Samans), and with the Prsthas they descended (from heaven). Yonder sun indeed in yonder world is surrounded by the Para (Samans) on both sides. In that there are Prsthas the sacrificers go by them to the world of heaven; they surround it from below with the Para (Samans), and by the Divakirtya (Saman) find support [1] in the world of heaven. They surround it from above with the Para (Samans), and descend with the Prsthas. If there were not Paras above, they would depart away from the world of heaven; if there were none below, they would. burn creatures. There are Parahsamans on both sides of the Divakirtya; verily they surround them on both sides in the world of heaven. The Divakirtya is the sacrificers, the Parahsamans the year; the Parahsamans are on both sides of the Divakirtya; verily on both sides [2] they find support in the year. The Divakirtya is the back, the Parahsamans the two sides; the Parahsamans are on both sides of the Divakirtya; therefore the sides are on both sides of the back. (In the rite) the greatest number of libations are made, the greatest number of Çastras recited; verily in the middle of the sacrifice they tie a knot not to slip. There are seven libations; seven are the breaths in the head; verily they place breaths in the sacrificers. In that the Prsthas are in succession, they mount upon yonder world with them. If they were not to descend to this world [3], the sacrificers would either go mad or perish. In that the Prsthas are reversed they descend to this world with them; verily also they find support in this world, for sanity. Indra was unsettled. He ran up to Prajapati; he gave him this (rite) of twenty-one nights; he grasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then indeed he became settled. Those, who sacrifice much and are unsettled [41, should perform (the rite) of twenty-one nights. There are twelve months, five seasons, three worlds here, and yonder sun as the twenty-first. So many are the worlds of the gods; verily in them in order they find support. Yonder sun did not shine. He ran up to Prajapati; he gave him this (rite) of twenty-one nights; he grasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then in deed did he shine. Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite) of twenty one nights, shine also. (The rite) is of twenty-one nights, the Ekavinśa (Stoma) is radiance; verily they attain radiance, and support also, for the Ekavinśa is support. There are Atiratras on either side, for securing splendour.<br>

<p>Brhaspati desired, &lsquo;May the gods have faith in me, and may I become their Purohita.&rsquo; He saw this (rite) of twenty-four nights; he grasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then the gods had faith in him, and he became their Purohita. In those who knowing thus perform the twenty four night (rite) men have faith, and they become their Purohitas. There are the three days Jyotis, Go, and Ayus. The Jyotis is this (earth), the Go the atmosphere, and the Ayus yonder (sky) [1]; verily they mount upon these worlds. The three days occur in order; verily in order do they mount upon the world of heaven. There can be no Sattra where there is no Chandoma; in that there are Chandomas, there is the Sattra. The gods they win by the Prsthas, the cattle by the Chandomas. The Prsthas are force and strength, the Chandomas cattle; verily in force and strength, and in cattle they find support. They proceed with the Brhat and the Rathantara (Samans). The Rathantara, is this (earth), the Brhat yonder (sky);</p>
<p>verily with them do they [2] proceed; verily also in them they find support. These indeed are the quick paths of the sacrifice; verily by them do they proceed to the world of heaven. (The rite is one) of twenty-four nights. Twenty four half-months make up the year; the year is the world of heaven; verily they find support in the year, the world of heaven. Now the Gayatri is of twenty-four syllables; the Gayatri is splendour; verily by the Gayatri they win splendour. There are Atiratras on either side, to secure splendour.</p>

<p>As are men, so were the gods in the beginning. They desired, &lsquo;Let us strike off the misfortune, the evil of death, and reach the conclave of the gods.&rsquo; They saw this twenty-four night (rite); they grasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then they struck off the misfortune, the evil of death, and reached the conclave of the gods. Those who knowing thus perform the twenty-four night (rite) strike off the misfortune, the evil, and win prosperity, for the conclave of the gods is in the case of man [1] prosperity. The Atiratra is light, for the lighting up of the world of heaven. There is a Prsthva Sadaha. The year consists of six seasons, and, entering it, the months, the half-months and the seasons reached the conclave of the gods. Those who knowing thus perform the twenty-four night rite, entering the year, reach a better station. There are three Trayastrinśas before, and three Trayastrinśas behind; verily with Trayastrinśas on either hand they strike off the evil of misfortune and in the middle reach the conclave of the gods [2], for the conclave of the gods is the Prsthas. There is uniformity in that there are three Trayastrinśas in succession, and a break in the uniformity in that there is in the middle one which is not defined. The Prsthas go onwards, the Chandomas go onwards; with both forms they go to the world of heaven. There can be no Sattra where there is no Chandoma; in that there are Chandomas, there is the Sattra. The gods they win by the Prsthas, the cattle by the Chandomas. The Prsthas are force and strength, the Chandomas cattle [3]; verily in force and strength and in cattle they find support. There are three Trayastrinśas before, and three Trayastrinśas behind; in the middle there are the Prsthas. The Trayastrinśas are the breast, the Prsthas the breath; verily thus the sacrificers don a protection for the breath, to avoid injury. They proceed with the Brhat and the Rathantara. The Rathantara is this (world), the Brhat yonder (world); verily they proceed with them; verily also in them they find support. These indeed are the quick paths of the sacrifice; verily by them do they [4] proceed to the world of heaven. They mount the world of heaven turning away (from earth) who perform the Prsthas in succession. The six-day (rite) is reversed for the return (from the heaven), and for support. Having prospered in either world they cease (the rite). They go from a Trivrt to a Trivrt, for the attainment of the Stomas, for pre eminence. There is an Agnistoma in the Jyotis form. This dwelling is this (world); verily by reason thereof they depart not from this dwelling. (The rite is one) of twenty-four nights. Twenty-four half months make up the year, the year is the world of heaven; verily they find support in the year, the world of heaven. Now the Gayatri is of twenty-four syllables; the Gayatri is splendour; verily by the Gayatri they win splendour. There are Atiratras on either side, to secure splendour.</p>

<p>This (earth) was bare and hairless. It desired, &lsquo;Let me be propagated with plants and trees.&rsquo; It saw these thirty nights. Then indeed it was propagated with plants and trees. Those who desire offspring and cattle should perform (the rite of) these (nights); they are propagated with offspring and cattle. This (earth) was hungry. It saw this Viraj, and placing it within itself it won food, plants [1], trees, offspring, cattle. Thereby it grew, it attained victoriousness and greatness. Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite of) these (nights), placing the Viraj in themselves, win food, grow great with offspring and cattle, and attain victoriousness and might. There is a Jyotistoma Atiratra, for the revealing of the world of heaven. There is a Prsthya Sadaha. The seasons are six, the Prsthas are six; verily by the Prsthas they reach the seasons, with the seasons the year; verily; the year [2] they find support. From the Trayastrinśas they go to the Trayastrinśa, for the continuity of the sacrifice. Now the Trayastrinśa is Prajapati; verily they seize hold of Prajapati, for support. There is a Trinava, for victory. There is an Ekavinśa, for support; verily they place radiance in themselves. There is a praise of Agni with the Trivrt; verily they bum away evil with it. Now the Trivrt is brilliance; verily</p>
<p>they place brilliance in themselves. There is a praise of Indra with the Pañcadaśa; verily they win power (indriyá) [3]. There is a Saptadaśa, for the winning of food; verily by it they are propagated. There is an Ekavinśa, for support; verily they place radiance in themselves. There is a Caturvinśa. Twenty-four half-months make up the year, the year is the world of heaven; verily they find support in the year, the world of heaven. Now there is the chief (day), and those who knowing thus perform (the rite of) these (nights) become the chief. From the Caturvinśa they go to the Prsthas. Verily having found support in the year [4] they attain the gods. From the Trayastrinśa they go to the Trayastrinśa. The gods are three and thirty; verily in the gods they find support. There is a Trinava. The Trinava is these worlds; verily in these worlds they find support. There are two Ekavinśas, for support; verily they place radiance in themselves. There are many Sodaśins, and therefore there are many males among offspring. In that these Stomas are intermingled, therefore this (earth) is covered with mingled plants and trees [5]. Those who knowing thus perform (the rite of) these (nights) have both offspring and cattle. These go imperfect to the world of heaven, for they resort to various Stomas; in that the Stomas are arranged in order, they go in order to the world of heaven, and there is order in both these worlds. These (nights) are thirty in number, the Viraj has thirty syllables; verily by the Viraj they win food. There are Atiratras on either hand, to secure food.</p>
<h4 id="04-42">04</h4>
<p>Prajapati went to the world of heaven. But with whatever metre the gods yoked him, they achieved not him. They saw (the rite of) these thirty-two nights. The Anustubh has thirty-two syllables, Prajapati is connected with the Anustubh; verily having gained Prajapati by his own metre they mounted on him and went to the world of heaven. Those who knowing thus perform (the rite of) these thirty-two (nights)&ndash;the Anustubh has thirty-two syllables, Prajapati is connected with the Anustubh-gaining Prajapati by his own metre, go to prosperity [1], for the world of heaven for man is prosperity. These (nights) are thirty-two, the Anustubh has thirty-two syllables, the Anustubh is speech; verily they gain all speech; all become speakers of speech, for all attain prosperity. There are the three days, Jyotis, Go, and Ayus. The Jyotis is this (earth), the Go the atmosphere, and the Ayus yonder (sky); verily they mount upon these worlds. The three days occur in order; verily in order do they mount upon the world of heaven. They proceed with the Brhat and Rathantara (Samans) [2]. The Rathantara is this (earth), the Brhat yonder (sky); verily with them do they proceed; verily also in them they find support. These indeed are the quick paths of the sacrifice; verily by them do they proceed to the world of heaven. Those who perform the three days in succession mount upon the world of heaven turning away (from earth). There is a three day period reversed, for returning (from heaven), and also for support. Having prospered in both worlds they cease (the rite). These (nights) are thirty-two. As for thirty of them, the Viraj has thirty syllables, the Viraj is food; verily by the Viraj they win food. As for the (remaining) two, they are days and nights, and by both forms they go to the world of heaven. There are Atiratras on either side, for security.</p>
<h4 id="05-42">05</h4>
<p>There are two Sattras of the gods, that of twelve days and that of thirty-three days. Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite of) thirty-three days, mount openly upon the deities. As a great man who has reached (the goal) seeks (more), so he does. If he fail he becomes worse; if he fail not, he remains the same. Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite of) thirty-three days, are distinguished from the evil enemy. The gods in the beginning seized these (nights), sharing the days [1]. One took one day, one another, and with them all equally prospered. Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite) of thirty-three days, all equally prosper, all gain the rank of village chief. There are five day periods; the year has five seasons; verily they rest on the seasons, the year. Again the Pankti has five syllables, the sacrifice is fivefold; verily they win the sacrifice. There are three (days with the) Aśvina (Çastra); three are these worlds; verily in these [2] worlds they find support. Again three are the powers of the sacrifice; verily they win them. There is a Viśvajit (day), for the winning of food. It has all the Prsthas, for the conquest of all. The twelve-day (rite) is speech. If they were to perform the twelve-day (rite) before (what has already gone), they would perform speech</p>
<p>imperfectly, and their speech would be likely to fail. They perform the twelve-day (rite) afterwards; verily they perform speech perfectly, and therefore we utter speech from above. Intermediately indeed [3] by means of a ten-nights' (rite) did Prajapati create offspring. In that there is a ten-nights' (rite), the sacrificers create offspring. Udanka Çaulbayana has declared the ten-night rite to be the prosperity of the Sattra. In that there is a ten-nights' rite, (it serves) for the prosperity of the Sattra. Verily also whatever is wrongly done in the former days, it serves to atone. These nights form two rows, the sacrificers are the Viśvajit, the first are sixteen with the Atiratra, the second are sixteen with the Atiratra. To those, who knowing thus perform (the rite) of thirty-three days, are born children in two rows. There are Atiratras on either side, for security.</p>
<h4 id="06-42">06</h4>
<p>The Adityas desired, &lsquo;Let us go to the world of heaven.&rsquo; They discerned not the world of heaven, they went not to the world of heaven. They saw this (rite) of thirty-six nights; they grasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then indeed did they discern the world of heaven, and went to the world of heaven. Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite) of thirty six nights, discern the world of heaven, and go to the world of heaven. The Atiratra is light [1]; verily they put light before them, to reveal the world of heaven. There are Sadahas; six are the seasons; verily in the seasons they find support. There are four (Sadahas); four are the quarters; verily in the quarters they find support. There can be no Sattra where there is no Chandoma; in that there are Chandomas, there is the Sattra. The gods they win by the Prsthas, the cattle by the Chandomas. The Prsthas are force and strength, the Chandomas cattle; verily in force [2] and strength they find support. (The rite has) thirty-six nights; the Brhati has thirty-six syllables, cattle are connected with the Brhati; verily by the Brhati they win cattle. The Brhati obtained the sovereignty over the metres. They obtain sovereignty who knowing thus perform (the rite) of thirty-six nights; verily they go to the world of heaven. There are Atiratras on either side, for the securing of the world of heaven.</p>
<h4 id="07-41">07</h4>
<p>Vasistha, his sons slain, desired, &lsquo;May I win offspring, and defeat the Sauddsas.&rsquo; He saw this (rite) of forty-nine nights; he grasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then indeed did he win offspring and defeated the Sauddsas. Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite) of forty-nine nights, win offspring and defeat their enemies. There are three Agnistomas with the Trivrt; verily they sharpen the point of the bolt. There are ten Pañcadaśas; the bolt is fifteenfold [1]; verily they take away the bolt from their rivals. The tenth day has a Sodaśin; verily they place strength in the bolt. There axe twelve Saptadaśas, to win food; verily also they are propagated by them. There is a Prsthya Sadaha. Six are the seasons, six the Prsthas; verily by the Prsthas they mount upon the seasons, by the seasons upon the year; verily in the year they find support. There are twelve Ekavinśas, for support; verily they place radiance in themselves [2]. There are many Sodaśins, for conquest. There are six (days) with the Aśvina (Çastra), six are the seasons; verily they rest on the seasons. These nights are deficient and redundant. They are deficient in that they are fifty less one, redundant in that they are (one) more than forty-eight. Both from the deficient, indeed, and from the redundant Prajapati was propagated. Those who desire offspring and cattle should perform (the rite of) these nights; verily are they propagated with offspring and cattle. This sacrifice is connected with the Viraj because it is one of forty-nine (nights). Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite) of forty-nine nights, attain the Viraj, and become eaters of food. There are Atiratras on either side, for the securing of food.</p>
<h4 id="08-40">08</h4>
<p>Those who are about to consecrate themselves for the year (rite) should consecrate themselves on the Ekastaka. The Ekastaka is the wife of the year; on that night he dwells with her; verily they consecrate themselves grasping openly the year. Those who consecrate themselves on the Ekastaka consecrate themselves in the troubled part of the year, for then are the two months called the end. Those who consecrate themselves on the Ekastaka consecrate themselves on the torn part of the year, for them are the two seasons called the end. They should consecrate themselves on the full</p>
<p>moon in Phalguni. The full moon in Phalguni is the beginning of the year [1]; verily they consecrate them selves grasping the year at its beginning. To that there is this one objection that the Visuvant day falls in the cloudy season. They should consecrate themselves on the full moon in Citra. The full moon in Citra, is the beginning of the year; verily they consecrate themselves grasping the year at the beginning. In that there is no objection at all. They should consecrate themselves on the fourth day before the full moon. Then the buying (of the Soma) falls for them on the Ekastaka; verily they do not waste the Ekastaka. In their case [2] the pressing-(day) falls on the first half (of the month), the months end in the first half, they complete (the rite) in the first half, and when they complete the rite the plants and trees come out after them. And after them follows the fair report, &lsquo;These sacrificers have succeeded&rsquo;, and therefore all succeed.</p>
<h4 id="09-41">09</h4>
<p>They go to the world of heaven who perform the Sattra. They kindle themselves with the Diksas, and cook themselves with the Upasads. With two they cut off their hair, with two their skin, with two their blood, with two their flesh, with two their bones, with two their marrow. In the Sattra the self is the sacrificial gift; verily taking the self as the gift they go to the world of heaven. They cut off the top-knot, for prosperity, (thinking), &lsquo;More swiftly may we attain the world of heaven.&rsquo;</p>
<h4 id="10-40">10</h4>
<p>The theologians say, &lsquo;The Atiratra is the highest of the forms of sacrifice. Why do they perform it first?&rsquo; Now in doing so they really perform in order first the Agnistoma, then the Ukthya, then the Sodaśin, then the Atiratra, all the forms of sacrifice, and seizing and holding them, they keep drinking the Soma. They perform the Jyotistoma first; the Jyotistoma is the beginning of the Stomas; verily they commence the Stomas from the beginning [1]. The Stomas being sung together make up the Viraj, and two verses are redundant; the Gostoma has one too many, and the Ayustoma one too few. The Jyotistoma is the world of heaven, the Viraj is strength; verily by it they go to the world of heaven. &lsquo;The Rathantara is used in the day, the Rathantara at night&rsquo;, say the theologians, &lsquo;what is used to avoid repetition?&rsquo; The great Saman of Sobhari is used as the Brahmasaman at the third pressing; it they place in the middle, to separate them; verily there is no repetition.</p>
<h4 id="11-39">11</h4>
<p>They first perform the Jyotistoma; verily by it they find support in this world. They perform secondly the Gostoma; verily by it they find support in the atmosphere. They perform thirdly the Ayustoma; verily by it they find support in yonder world. The Jyotis is this (earth), the Go the atmosphere, and the Ayus yonder (sky). In that they perform these Stomas, the performers of the Sattra keep finding support in these worlds. These, (Stomas) being sung together make up the Viraj [1], and two verses are redundant; the Gostoma has one too many, and the Ayustoma one too few. The Jyotistoma is the world of heaven, the Viraj is strength; verily they win strength. They experience not misery through hunger, and are not hungry, for the performers of Sattras are as it were afflicted with hunger. The two Agnistomas on either side are the rims, the Ukthyas in the middle the nave, and that is the circling wheel of the gods. In that they go [2] by that Sadaha, they mount the wheel of the gods, for safety. They obtain prosperity. They go with the Sadaha; there are six seasons; verily in the seasons they find support. The go with a Jyotistoma on either hand; verily on either hand they find support in the world of heaven. There are two Sadahas, they make up twelve days. Man is of twelve parts, two thighs, two arms, the trunk and the head, four members, and the breasts as the eleventh and twelfth [3]. Therefore (the days) follow man. There are three Sadahas, they make up eighteen days, nine and nine. Nine are the breaths in man; verily they follow the breaths. There are four Sadahas, they make up twenty-four days. The year consists of twenty four half-months; verily they follow the year. &lsquo;The year is not fixed&rsquo;, they say. &lsquo;It is greater than a support.&rsquo; The Brahmana of the month is that of the year also verily they go finding support in each month.<br>

<h4 id="01-41">01</h4>
<p>The cows performed that Sattra, being hornless, with the desire, &lsquo;May horns be born to us.&rsquo; For ten months they performed it, and then horns were born, and they ceased (the rite), (saying), &lsquo;We have obtained (our desire).&rsquo; Then those whose horns were not born ceased (the rite) after making up the year, (saying), &lsquo;We have obtained (our desire).&rsquo; Both those which obtained horns and those which<br>
did not ceased, (saying),&lsquo;We have obtained (our desire).&rsquo; The year is the cows' Sattra [1], and those</p>
<p>who knowing thus perform the year (sacrifice) are prosperous. Therefore a hornless cow has pleasure during the two months of the rainy season, for that is won for it by the Sattra. Therefore whatever is done in the house of one who performs for a year (a Sattra), that is done completely, successfully, and adequately. Those who perform the year (Sattra) are swimming on the ocean. He who does not see the further bank of the ocean cannot get out from it. The ocean is the year [2]. Its further banks are the two Atiratras. Those who knowing thus perform the year (Sattra) reach the end without injury. The former Atiratra is this (earth), the latter is yonder (sky); the former is mind, the latter speech; the former expiration, the latter inspiration; the former the commencement, the latter the end. The Atiratra is a Jyotistoma, of Vaiśvanara; verily they put light before them, to reveal the world of heaven. There is a fore offering, accompanied by the Caturvinśa Stoma. The year has twenty-four half-months [3]; verily as they go on they find support in the year. There are three hundred and sixty Stotriyas; so many are the nights of the year; verily they attain both forms of the year.<br>
They perform (the rites of) the next days for rest, for safety. There are six-day periods. The year has six seasons; verily they find support in the seasons, the year. The Go and the Ayus (Stomas) are the Stomas in the middle; verily they place a pair in the middle of the year [4] for procreation. On either<br>
side there is the Jyotistoma. It is the releasing; verily the metres are released; verily also they go to the world of heaven with the six-day (rite) which has a Jyotistoma on either side. The theologians say, &lsquo;They sit; by what path do they go?&rsquo; One should reply,' By the path that leads to the gods. The<br>
path that leads to the gods is the metres, the Gayatri, Tristubh, and Jagati. The Gayatri is the Jyotistoma, the Tristubh, the Gostoma, the Jagati the Ayustoma. In that there are these Stomas, so do they go by the path that leads to the gods [5]. There is used the same Saman. The Saman is the world of the gods; verily they leave not the world of the gods. There are used various verses. The verses are the world of man; verily they keep mounting one world of gods after another from the world of men. There is the Brahman&rsquo;s Saman as the Abhivarta to win the world of heaven. There is the Abhijit (day) for the gaining of the world of heaven. There is the Viśvajit (day) for the gaining of all. Month by month they perform the Prsthas, month by month the Atigrahyas are drawn; verily in each month they place strength, for the support of the months. They perform the Prsthas in the latter part of the month. Therefore it is on the top that the plants bear fruit.</p>
<h4 id="02-41">02</h4>
<p>The cows performed that Sattra, being hornless and desiring to obtain horns. For ten months they performed it, and then horns appeared. They said, &lsquo;We have gained (them), let us cease (the rite), for we have attained the desire for the sake of which we began (the rite).&rsquo; But others said, either half of them or as many as might be the case, &lsquo;Let us perform (the rite) for these months, the eleventh and the twelfth, and when we have made up the year, let us cease&rsquo; [1]. In their case their horns grew in the twelfth month. Whether by faith, or by lack of faith-that is, those which have no horns-both indeed were prosperous, those which gained horns and those which won strength. He who ceases after ten months is prosperous, and he who ceases after twelve also, if he knows thus. They go by their feet, and he who goes by his foot attains (what he seeks). The Ayana is successful, and therefore is it productive of cows.</p>
<h4 id="03-42">03</h4>
<p>They perform the Prahas in the first month, they perform them in the middle month, they perform them in the last month. They say, &lsquo;In the case of a cow which they milk thrice a day, she yields sparingly at the latter two milkings; how then can she be milked who is twelve times milked?&rsquo; Having made up the year, they should perform the Prsthas once in the last month; verily the sacrificers win the sacrifice and cattle. It is an ocean [1] without a near or a further shore that they enter upon who perform the year (rite). If they employ the Brhat and the Rathantara Samans, it would be as if they were to provide a boat in the middle of the ocean. Going continuously with the Brhat and the Rathantara they obtain support. The union is milked for all desires; thus the sacrificers obtain all desires.</p>
<h4 id="04-43">04</h4>
<p>The Rcs are the same. The Rcs are the world of men; verily they leave not the world of man. There are different Samans; the Saman is the world of the gods; verily they descend from the world of the gods to one world after another of men. They first use the Jagati, and the metres descend from the Jagati, the cups from the Agrayana, the Prsthas from the Brhat, the Stomas from the Trayastrinśa. Therefore the younger descends before an elder. The Viśvakarman cup is drawn; verily by it the sacrificers win all rites. The cup for Aditi [1] is drawn. Aditi is this (earth); verily they rest on this (earth). The one and the other are drawn, for pairing, for propagation. Of old Prajapati created offspring by means of the ten-night (rite); in that the ten-night rite is performed, the sacrificers create offspring. Udanka Çaulbayana has declared the ten-night rite to be the prosperity of the Sattra, and the ten-night rite serves for the prosperity of the Sattra. Verily also whatever is done wrongly in the earlier days, this serves to atone for it.</p>
<h4 id="05-43">05</h4>
<p>If two libations are offered simultaneously, then one should perform the early litany in the advanced part of the night. He who does it first wins the speech, the gods, and the metres (of the others). The strophe should contain the word &lsquo;strong (vrsan)'; verily he takes Indra away from their morning pressing. Or rather they say, &lsquo;The strophe at the beginning of each pressing should be of this kind&rsquo;; verily he takes Indra away from each of their pressings.<br>
For entry, for rest, for the overcoming, of the Gayatri, of the Tristubh, of the Jagati, of the Anustubh, of the Pankti, hail!<br>
Entry and rest are the metres; verily by the metres [1], he takes away their metres. One should recite the Sajaniya hymn; one should recite the Vihavya hymn; one should recite the Kayaśubhiya hymn of Agastya. This indeed is so much as that, verily he takes away so much as is theirs. If at the early pressing the bowl is broken, they should sing verses addressed to Visnu and containing the epithet Çipivista. Whatever in the sacrifice is redundant, is redundant with regard to Visnu Çipivista; verily Visnu Çipivista places the redundant in the redundant. Verily having obtained the redundant by the redundant, they win it. If it is broken at the midday pressing, they should make the Saman have the Vasatkara as its finale. The support of the sacrifice is the Vasatkara; verily they make the Saman obtain support. If it breaks at the third pressing, the same thing (should be done).</p>
<h4 id="06-43">06</h4>
<p>Having made up the month with the six-day periods they leave out a day, for they behold the months by the six-day periods. Having made up the months with the half-months, they leave out a day, for they behold the months by the half-months. Having made up the months by the new moon night, they leave out a day, for they behold the months by the new moon night. Having made up the months by the full moon night, they leave out a day, for they behold the month by the full moon night. He who pours (liquid) into a full (vessel) wastes the liquid; he who pours out from a full (vessel) [1] places breath in it. In that, having made up the months with the full moon night, they leave out a day, they place breath in the year, and the performers of the Sattra breathe along it. If they did not leave out a day, then the year would fall asunder, as falls asunder a skin bag tied tight, and they would be ruined. In that, having made up the months with the full moon night, they leave out a day, they place out-breathing in the year, and the performers of the Sattra breathe out along it [2], and are not ruined. At the full moon (the Soma) of the gods is pressed. In that, having made up the months with the full moon night, they leave out a day, with the sacrifice to the gods they go to another sacrifice. They cleave asunder the sacrifice, in that (after performing it) as a series of six day rites they leave out a day. They offer an animal for Prajapati. Prajapati is all the gods; verily with the gods do they offer the sacrifice. They leave the pressing [3], who leave out the day. The Samnayya is the fourth pressing. Because there is the Samnayya, they do not leave the pressing. They partake of it after uttering the invocation, for they have this then as their Soma drink. The deities who share in the pressings of those who leave out the day go to their places; they offer the sacrificial cakes in each of the pressings; verily they win the deities who share in the pressing from</p>
<p>their several places. (They offer the cakes) on eight potsherds at the early pressing, on eleven potsherds at the midday pressing, and on twelve potsherds at the third pressing; verily they obtain and win the metres. They offer an oblation to the All-gods at the third pressing. The third pressing belongs to the All-gods; verily they leave not the third pressing.</p>
<h4 id="07-42">07</h4>
<p>The theologians consider, &lsquo;Should (a day) be left out, or should it not be left out?&rsquo; They say, &lsquo;It should be left out.&rsquo; They say, &lsquo;It should be left out at the new moon and at the full moon, for these two guide the sacrifice.&rsquo; &lsquo;These two must not be left out,&rsquo; they say, &lsquo;for these two determine the dependent sacrifice.&rsquo; &lsquo;(The day) should be left out on the first Vyastaka,&rsquo; they say, &lsquo;for this is what rends the month.&rsquo; They should not leave out a day which is appointed [1]. If they should leave out one which is appointed, they should leave it out on the seventh day after making up the months with six-day periods, whatever be the recur rent position which it occupies in the course of the six-day period. They should then offer to Agni, with the Vasus, a cake on eight potsherds, to Indra curds, to Indra with the Maruts a cake on eleven potsherds, to the All-gods a cake on twelve potsherds. The early pressing belongs to Agni with the Vasus; in that they offer to Agni with the Vasus a cake on eight potsherds, they make the god share in it [2], and they approach the pressing with eight. In that the curds belong to Indra, they do not shut out Indra from a share. The midday pressing belongs to Indra with the Maruts. In that they offer to Indra with the Maruts a cake on eleven potsherds, they make the god share in it, and they approach the pressing with eleven [3]. The third pressing belongs to the All-gods with the Rbhus. In that they offer to the All-gods a cake on twelve pot sherds, they make the gods share in it, and they approach the pressing with twelve. They offer a beast to Prajapati-Prajapati is the sacrifice that the sacrifice may not be abandoned. For six months (as they go) hence the Brahman&rsquo;s Saman should be the &lsquo;victorious&rsquo;. The &lsquo;victorious&rsquo; is the holy power (Brahman); verily they go winning the world of heaven by the holy power (Brahman); for the world of heaven is as it were opposite from hence. When they come thence the Brahman&rsquo;s Saman for six months should be &lsquo;O Indra, bear us strength, as a father to his sons. Guide us, O thou that art much invoked, on our path. Living, may we attain the light.&rsquo; The light is this world, the light is offspring; verily they come, gazing on this world by repeating the verse.</p>
<h4 id="08-41">08</h4>
<p>When the gods had come to the end, their power and strength departed. They won them again by the Krośa (Saman), and that is why the Krośa has the name. In that they sing the Krośa at the end of the pit, they win power and strength at the end of the sacrifice. They sing the Sattra syarddhi (Saman) at the end of the Ahavaniya; verily, making Agni a witness, they advance to prosperity. They sing the<br>
Prajapater Hrdaya within the shed; verily they win his favour. They sing the Çloka (Saman) in front of the Sadas [1], the Anuśloka (Saman) behind; verily fame is their portion at the end of the sacrifice. The Adhvaryu sings nine (verses). Nine are the breaths in man; verily he places breaths in the sacrificers. All of them are addressed to Indra; verily he places power (indriya) in the breaths. He sings without the Pratihara. Therefore a man can contract all the other members (of the body) except the head, but the bead not. The Rathantara (Saman) has the Pañcadaśa (Stoma); verily they win power. The Brhat has the Saptadaśa [2], for the winning of food; verily also they are propagated by it. The Bhadra (Saman) has the Ekavinśa (Stoma) with Dvipada verses, for support. The wives (of the sacrificers) sing, for offspring, for propagation. Prajapati created offspring; he desired, &lsquo;May I gain the kingship over them.&rsquo; He obtained the kingship over them by the Rajana (Saman), and that is why the Rajana has the name. In that there is the Rajana, the sacrificers obtain the kingship over offspring. It has the Pañcavinśa (Stoma), to win Prajapati [3]. They sing five (verses) standing; verily they win the world of the gods; five sitting; verily they win the world of men. These come to ten; the Viraj is of ten syllables, the Viraj is food; verily they win food by the Viraj. In five places they sing sitting down; there are five quarters; verily they rest on the quarters. They come up each before one verse has been sung; verily they bear food from the quarters. The Udgatr sings these (verses); verily having borne food from the quarters [4] they place glory in themselves. Therefore one breath protects all the limbs. Therefore, just as a bird about to fly</p>
<p>upwards raises its head aloft, so the sacrificers are highest among people. The Udgatr mounts a throne; verily they attain rule. The Hotr (mounts) a swing; verily they mount the back of the firmament. The Adhvaryu (mounts) two mats; verily they reach the surface of the ruddy one. So many indeed are the worlds, and in them in order they find support. Then the sacrificers make thus a bridge to mount, for the gaining of the world of heaven.</p>
<h4 id="09-42">09</h4>
<p>By means of the Arkya (Saman) Prajapati created offspring in thousands. From them by means of the Ilamda (Saman) he took away the food they had gathered. In that there is the Arkya, the sacrificers create offspring; in that there is the Ilamda, they take away from the offspring which has been created the food they have gathered. Therefore, in whatever year the Sattra is performed, the offspring are hungry in that year, for they take their food and strength; in whatever year the Sattra is imperfect, the offspring are not hungry in that year [1]; for they take not their food and strength. They raise a loud noise. As men being freed from bonds cry aloud, so the sacrificers freed from the bonds of the gods cry aloud, placing food and strength in themselves. The lute has a hundred strings. Man is of a hundred (years) of age, and of a hundredfold strength; verily they find support in age and strength. They run a race, to win what has not yet been won. They beat drums; the voice of the drum is the highest (form of) speech; verily they win the highest (form of) speech. They beat the earth-drum; verily they win that speech which has entered this (earth); verily also they conquer the earth. All (forms of) speech they utter, to gain all (forms of speech). Two strive on a dry hide, to gain strength. One reviles, another extols. He who reviles purifies them, he who extols places food in them after they are purified. They win by the first months what is done by the Rsis and by the gods; in that the Bhutechad Samans are used, both are gained. Those who perform the year rite lose their virility. There are a pair united within the sacrificial ground; verily they lose not virility.</p>
<h4 id="10-41">10</h4>
<p>They pierce the hide; verily they remove the sin of the (sacrificers). &lsquo;Do not miss, do not pierce through&rsquo;, he says; verily they now remove their sin. Slave girls dance round the Marjaliya fire with water-pots on their heads, beating the ground with their feet, and singing &lsquo;This is honey.&rsquo; Honey indeed is the chiefest food of the gods; verily they win the chiefest food. They beat the ground with their feet; verily they endow the (sacrificers) with might.</p>

<p>Now for the fire which is produced on the fire-altar and for Soma, the king, the beast for Agni and Soma is the guest-offering. Again the fire which is piled up is cruel, and if one were not to cast upon the fire which has been piled up these oblations, the cruel fire would spring up in wrath, and injure the offspring and cattle of the sacrificer. In that he casts the oblations on the fire which has been piled up, he appeases it with its own portion, and the cruel fire [1] does not spring up in wrath and injure his offspring and cattle. There are ten oblations. Nine are the breaths in man, and the navel is the tenth; verily he places breaths in the sacrificer. Again the Viraj is of ten syllables; the Viraj is food; verily he finds support in the Viraj as food. &lsquo;It must be piled with the seasons, the metres, the Stomas, and the Prsthas&rsquo;, they say. In that he casts these oblations, he piles it with the seasons, the metres, the Stomas, and the Prsthas. &lsquo;The quarters can be won by one who has pressed the Soma&rsquo; they say [2]. In that he casts these oblations, (it is) for the winning of the quarters. The gods made Indra sacrifice with it, and therefore is it Indra&rsquo;s pressing; men made Manu sacrifice with it, and therefore is it Manu&rsquo;s pressing. As Indra among the gods, as Manu among men, becomes he who knowing thus sacrifices with this sacrifice. The Puronuvakyas contain the word &lsquo;quarter&rsquo;, for the conquest of the quarters.</p>

<p>He who knows the head of the sacrificial horse becomes possessed of a head and fit for sacrifice. The head of the sacrificial horse is the dawn, the eye the sun, the breath the wind, the ear the moon, the feet the quarters, the ribs the intermediate quarters, the winking the day and night, the joints the half-months, the joinings the months, the limbs the seasons, the trunk the year, the hair the rays (of the gun), the form the Naksatras, the bones the stars, the flesh the mist, the hair the plants, the tail hairs the trees, the mouth Agni, the open (mouth) Vaiśvanara [1], the belly the sea, the anus the atmosphere, the testicles the sky and the earth, the membrum virile, the pressing-stone, the seed the Soma. When it chews, there is lightning; when it moves about, there is thundering; when it makes water, there is rain; its speech is speech. The Mahiman (cup) indeed is born before the birth of the horse as the day. The Mahiman (cup) is born after it as the night. These two Mahiman (cups) surround on either side the horse. As Haya (steed) it carried the gods, as Arvan (courser) the Asuras, as Vajin (racer) the Gandharvas, as Aśva (horse) men. The birthplace of the horse, indeed, is the sea, its kindred is the sea.</p>
