Mounting the heaven above the highest vault.</p>
<h4 id="b-65">b</h4>
<p>These are wings unaging of thee, the winged,<br>
Wherewith thou dost smite away the Raksases, O Agni;<br>
With these may we fly to the world of good men,<br>
Where are the seers, the first-born, those of yore.</p>
<h4 id="c-63">c</h4>
<p>Thou art piling, born of the ocean, the drop,<br>
The skilled one, the eagle, the righteous,<br>
The golden-winged busy bird, mighty,<br>
That hath sat down firmly in its place [1].</p>
<h4 id="d-61">d</h4>
<p>Homage be to thee; harm me not,<br>
Thou dost stand resting on the head of all;<br>
Within the ocean is thy heart, thy life;<br>
Sky and earth are placed on the worlds.</p>
<h4 id="e-58">e</h4>
<p>Give of the water, cleave the holder of the water; from the sky, from Parjanya, from the atmosphere, from the earth, thence do ye help us with rain; thou art the head of the sky, the navel of earth, the strength of waters and plants, protection of all life, extending; homage to the way!</p>
<h4 id="f-55">f</h4>
<p>With that devotion wherewith the seers performed the session of sacrifice [2], Kindling Agni, bearing aloft the heaven,<br>
I set on this vault that Agni<br>
Whom men call him for whom the spread is strewed.</p>
<h4 id="g-52">g</h4>
<p>Him with our wives let us pursue, O gods,<br>
With our sons, our brothers, or by gold,<br>
Seizing the vault in the world of good action,<br>
Above the third firmament, in the light of the sky.</p>
<h4 id="h-52">h</h4>
<p>To the middle of speech hath the busy one arisen,<br>
Agni here, lord of the good, the wise;<br>
Established on the back of the earth, the radiant one,<br>
He casteth beneath his feet [3] the combatants.</p>
<h4 id="i-51">i</h4>
<p>Let Agni here, the most manly, strength-bestowing,<br>
Of a thousand shapes, shine unwearying,<br>
Radiant in the midst of the ocean;<br>
Do ye approach the abodes divine.</p>
<h4 id="k-48">k</h4>
<p>Move ye forward, go ye long together;<br>
Make ye the paths gods travelled, O Agni;<br>
In this highest abode<br>
O All-gods, sit ye with the sacrificer.</p>
<h4 id="l-22">l</h4>
<p>That by which thou bearest a thousand,<br>
Thou, O Agni, all wealth,<br>
With that highest (path) for the gods to travel,<br>
Do thou bear this sacrifice for us.</p>
<h4 id="m-37">m</h4>
<p>Awake, O Agni; be roused for him;<br>
With this one do thou create sacrifice and donation;</p>
<p>Making thee, his father, young again<br>
He hath stretched over thee this covering.</p>
<h4 id="n-35">n</h4>
<p>This is thy due place of birth,<br>
Whence born thou didst shine,<br>
Mount it, O Agni, knowing it,<br>
And make our wealth increase.</p>
<h3 id="14">14</h3>
<h4 id="a-67">a</h4>
<p>May radiance be mine, O Agni, in rival invocations, May we, kindling thee, make ourselves to prosper; To me let the four quarters bow;<br>
With thee as overseer may we conquer the fighters.</p>
<h4 id="b-66">b</h4>
<p>Let all the gods be at my invocation,<br>
The Maruts with Indra, Visnu, Agni;<br>
May the broad atmosphere be my guardian;<br>
May the wind blow for me unto this desire.</p>
<h4 id="c-64">c</h4>
<p>May the gods bestow wealth upon me through sacrifice; May blessing be mine, and mine divine invocation; The divine sacrificers of old shall win for us [1];<br>
Unharmed may we be in ourselves, rich in heroes.</p>
<h4 id="d-62">d</h4>
<p>For me let them sacrifice whatever sacrifices are mine Fulfilled be the intent of my mind;<br>
No sin whatever may I commit;<br>
May the All-gods befriend me.</p>
<h4 id="e-59">e</h4>
<p>O ye six spaces divine, for us make broad room; O ye All-gods, here show your prowess;<br>
May we not lose offspring nor ourselves;<br>
May we not fall victims to our foe, O king Soma.</p>
<h4 id="f-56">f</h4>
<p>Agni, driving away wrath in front [2],<br>
As guardian unfailing, do thou guard us on all sides; Let thy foes turn away again<br>
And be their plotting at home ruined through thy foresight.</p>
<h4 id="g-53">g</h4>
<p>The creator of creators, lord of the world,<br>
The god Savitr overcoming enmity,<br>
This sacrifice may the two Aśvins and Brhaspati, The gods (guard) and protect the sacrificer from misfortune.</p>
<h4 id="h-53">h</h4>
<p>May the bull, wide extending, afford us protection rich in food, He much invoked in this invocation;<br>
O thou of the bay steeds, be gracious unto our progeny; Harm us not [3], abandon not us.</p>
<h4 id="i-52">i</h4>
<p>May our rivals depart;<br>
With Indra and Agni we overthrow them;<br>
The Vasus, the Rudras, the Adityas have made me A dread corrector and overlord, sky reaching.</p>
<h4 id="k-49">k</h4>
<p>Hitherward do we summon Indra from thence,<br>
Him who is winner of cows, of booty, and winner too of horses; Do thou accept this sacrifice at our invocation;<br>
Ally of it we make thee, O lord of the bays.<br>
The Horse Sacrifice</p>
<h3 id="15">15</h3>
<h4 id="a-68">a</h4>
<p>Of Agni first I reckon, the wise ones,<br>
Him of the five folk whom many kindle;<br>
Him who hath entered into every concourse do we implore, May he relieve us from tribulation.</p>
<h4 id="b-67">b</h4>
<p>Him whose is that which breatheth, which winketh, which moveth, Whose alone is that which has been born and is being born, Agni I praise; I invoke seeking aid,<br>
May he relieve us from tribulation.</p>
<h4 id="c-65">c</h4>
<p>Of Indra first I reckon, the wise one;<br>

<p>Him who in might leadeth forth the host for battle,<br>
Who commingleth the three possessions;<br>
Indra I praise; I invoke seeking aid,<br>

<h4 id="e-60">e</h4>
<p>Of you, O Mitra and Varuna, I reckon<br>
Take heed of him, O ye of true strength, strong ones, whom ye afflict; Ye who go in might against the king in his chariot,<br>
May ye relieve us from sin.</p>
<h4 id="f-57">f</h4>
<p>You whose chariot with straight reins, of true path,<br>
Approacheth to spoil him who acteth falsely,<br>
Mitra and Varuna I praise [2]; I invoke seeking aid,<br>
May ye relieve us from sin.</p>
<h4 id="g-54">g</h4>
<p>We venerate the ordinances of Vayu and of Savitr,<br>
Who support that which hath life and guard it,<br>
Who surround all things;<br>
May ye relieve us from sin.</p>
<h4 id="h-54">h</h4>
<p>The best blessings have come to us<br>
In the realm of the two gods;<br>
I praise Vayu and Savitr; I invoke seeking aid,<br>
May ye relieve us from sin.</p>
<h4 id="i-53">i</h4>
<p>Best charioteers of carmen, I hail for aid,<br>
That go most smoothly with well-guided steeds;<br>
Ye [3] whose might among the gods, O gods, is unextinguished, May ye relieve us from sin.</p>
<h4 id="k-50">k</h4>
<p>What time ye came to the wedding of Surya,<br>
Choosing a seat together on the three-wheeled (chariot), I praise you, Aśvins, gods, invoke seeking aid,<br>
May ye relieve us from sin.</p>
<h4 id="l-23">l</h4>
<p>Of the Maruts I reckon; may they aid us;<br>
May they all help this every prayer (of ours);<br>
The swift, easily controlled (ones) I call to help,<br>
May they relieve us from evil.</p>
<h4 id="m-38">m</h4>
<p>The sharp weapon, strong and mighty,<br>
The divine host [4] keen in the battles,<br>

May they relieve us from evil.</p>
<h4 id="n-36">n</h4>
<p>Of the gods I reckon; may they aid us;<br>
May they all help this every prayer;<br>

<p>That which now consumeth me<br>
From deed of men or gods,</p>
<p>I praise the All-gods; I invoke seeking aid,<br>
May they free us from evil.</p>
<h4 id="p-26">p</h4>
<p>Us to-day Anumati.</p>
<h4 id="q-19">q</h4>
<p>O Anumati, thou [5].</p>
<h4 id="r-18">r</h4>
<p>Vaiśvanara for aid to us.</p>
<h4 id="s-14">s</h4>
<p>Present in sky.</p>
<h4 id="t-13">t</h4>
<p>Those that expanded with unmeasured might,<br>
Those that became the supports of wealth,<br>
I praise sky and earth; I invoke seeking aid,<br>
May ye relieve us from tribulation.</p>

<p>O ye broad firmaments, make room for us;<br>
O rulers of the field, aid us;<br>
I praise sky and earth; I invoke seeking aid,<br>
May ye relieve us from tribulation.</p>
<h4 id="v-5">v</h4>
<p>Whatever sin we commit against thee,<br>
As men are wont in ignorance, O most young [6],<br>
Make us blameless before Aditi,<br>
Remove our evil deeds on all sides, O Agni.</p>
<h4 id="w-5">w</h4>
<p>Even as ye did set free, O bright ones,<br>
O ye that are worthy of offering, the buffalo cow bound by the foot, So do thou remove from us tribulation;<br>
Be our life prolonged further, O Agni.</p>
