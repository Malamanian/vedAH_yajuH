<p>The gods and the Asuras were in conflict; the gods, in anticipation of the contest, deposited in Agni their desirable riches (thinking),&lsquo;This will still be ours, if they defeat us. Agni desired it and went</p>
<p>away with it. The gods having defeated (the Asuras) pursued (Agni) desirous of recovering it. They sought violently to take it from him. He wept; in that he wept (arodit), that is why Rudra has his name. The tear that [1] was shed became silver; therefore silver is not a suitable gift, for it is born of tears. He who gives on the strew, in his house before the year is out they weep; therefore one should not give on the strew. Agni said, &lsquo;Let me have a share; then this will be yours.&rsquo; They replied, &lsquo;The re-establishing shall be thine alone.&rsquo; &lsquo;He shall prosper&rsquo;, he said, who shall establish the fire with me as its divinity.&rsquo; Pusan established it; therefore [2] did Pusan prosper; therefore cattle are said to be Pusan&rsquo;s. Tvastr established it; therefore did Tvastr prosper; therefore cattle are said to be Tvastr&rsquo;s. Manu established it; therefore did Manu prosper; therefore offspring are said to be Manu&rsquo;s. Dhatr established it; therefore Dhatr prospered; Dhatr is the year; therefore offspring and cattle are born in the course of the year. He who knows thus the prosperity of the re-establishing [3] prospers. He who knows his connexions becomes possessed of connexions himself. Agni desiring a share after being established assailed the offspring and cattle of the sacrifice. Having removed it, one should re-establish it; thus he unites him with his own portion; verily he is appeased. He should establish under Punarvasu; Punarvasu is the Naksatra for the re-establishing; verily by establishing it under its own deity he becomes resplendent. He establishes with Darbha grass, for variety. He establishes with Darbha; verily winning it from the waters and the plants he establishes it. The sacrificial cake is offered on five potsherds; the seasons are five; verily he wins it from the seasons and establishes it.</p>
<h2 id="02">02</h2>
<p>He who removes the fire casts away the sacrifice and cattle. The sacrificial cake is offered on five potsherds; the sacrifice is fivefold, cattle are fivefold; verily he wins the sacrifice and cattle. Now he who removes the fire is the slayer of the hero among the gods; Brahmans desirous of holiness did not aforetime eat his food; the Yajyas and Anuvakyas are in the Pankti metre; the sacrifice is fivefold, man is fivefold; verily making recompense to the gods for the hero he re-establishes the fire [1]. They are of a hundred syllables; man lives a hundred years and has a hundred powers; verily he rests on life and power. In that Agni when established does not prosper, (it is that he is) desiring a greater portion; in that it is all Agni&rsquo;s, that is his prosperity. Speech is uttered together in the house of him who removes the fire; the sacrificer is liable to perish on account of the uttering together of speech. There are discriminations, to sever speech and preserve the sacrificer [2]. He makes a discrimination; verily he makes the holy power (Brahman). He speaks the Yajus, muttering; it is as if one who has found a rich treasure hides it. To Agni Svistakrt he speaks aloud; it is as if one who has found a rich treasure is fain to go openly. Uttering the discrimination he makes the Vasat cry with the foresacrifice; verily he leaves not his abode. The sacrificial cake is the sacrificer, the oblations are cattle; in that he offers these libations on either side of the cake [3], he thus surrounds the sacrificer on either side with cattle. &lsquo;After performing the Yajus and collecting the apparatus&rsquo;, they say: &rsquo;the apparatus should not be collected, the Yajus should not be performed,&rsquo; they say: the apparatus should be collected and the Yajus performed, for the prosperity of the sacrifice. The sacrificial fee is a renovated chariot, a newly-sewn garment, a draught ox let loose again, for the prosperity of the re-establishing. &lsquo;Seven are thy kindling-sticks, O Agni, seven thy tongues&rsquo;; (with these words) he offers the Agnihotra. Wherever there is anything of his nature, thence [4] does he win him. Now he who removes the fire is the slayer of the hero among the gods, Varuna is the exactor of the recompense; he should make an offering on eleven potsherds to Agni and Varuna; him whom he slays and him who exacts the recompense he delights with their own portion; the sacrificer is not ruined.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Earth in depth, sky in breadth,&rsquo; he says; with this benediction he establishes it. The serpents thought that they were growing worn out; Kasarnira Kadraveya beheld this Mantra; then did they strike off their worn-out skins. With the verses of the queen of serpents he establishes the Garhapatya, and so renewing it he establishes it as immortal. Pure food did not come to the earth; she [1] beheld this Mantra; then food came to her. In that he establishes the Garhapatya with the verses of the serpent queen (it serves) for the winning of food; verily he establishes it firm in the (earth). &lsquo;If thee in anger I have scattered&rsquo;, he says; verily he conceals it from him. &lsquo;Again thee we relight&rsquo;, he says; verily he kindles him all together. &lsquo;Whatever of thee scattered in rage&rsquo;, he says; verily by means of the deities [2] he unites him. The sacrifice of him who removes the fire is split; he pays reverence with a verse containing the word Brhaspati; Brhaspati is the holy power (Brahman) of the gods; verily by holy power (Brahman) he unites the sacrifice. &lsquo;May he unite this scattered sacrifice&rsquo;, he says, for continuity, &lsquo;May the All-gods rejoice herein&rsquo;, he says; verily continuing the sacrifice he points it out to the gods. &lsquo;Seven are thy kindling-sticks, O Agni, seven thy tongues&rsquo; [3], he says, for sevenfold in seven-wise are the dear forms of Agni; verily he wins them. &lsquo;Return with strength&rsquo;, &lsquo;Return with wealth&rsquo;, (with these words) he offers oblations on either side of the sacrificial cake; verily with strength and with wealth he surrounds on either side the sacrificer. The Adityas went from this world to yonder world, they were thirsty in yonder world, having returned to this world and having established the fire, they offered these oblations; they prospered, they went to the world of heaven. He, who establishes a fire after the second establishment, should offer these oblations; be prospers with the prosperity where with the Adityas prospered.</p>

<p>There is no sacrifice without a Saman. &lsquo;As we approach the sacrifice&rsquo;, he says; verily he yokes a Stoma with it. &lsquo;Approach&rsquo;, he says; offspring and cattle approach the world; verily he approaches cattle and offspring and this world. &lsquo;After his ancient splendour&rsquo;, he says; the ancient is the world of heaven; verily he mounts upon the world of heaven. &lsquo;Agni is the head of the sky, the height&rsquo;, he says; verily he makes him the head [1] of his equals, and verily from the world of the gods he rests in the world of men. &lsquo;Here hath he first been established by the establishers&rsquo;, he says; verily he</p>
<p>makes him the principal. &lsquo;Ye twain shall be summoned, O Indra and Agni&rsquo;, he says; verily he wins might and force. &lsquo;This is thy due place of birth&rsquo;, he says; wealth is cattle; verily he wins cattle. With six (verses) he pays reverence; the seasons are six [2]; verily he rests on the seasons. With six subsequent (verses) he pays reverence; they make up twelve; the year has twelve months; verily he rests on the year. Just as a man, a horse, a cow, are worn out, so the fire when established wears out; at the end of the year he pays reverence with (verses) containing the words Agni and pu; verily he renews it and makes it unageing, and also purifies it. He pays reverence; that is his union. He pays reverence [3]; that is his bond. He pays reverence; that is his appeal. He pays reverence; that is as if an inferior brings (something) to a superior and pays him honour. &lsquo;Thou art giver of life, O Agni; give me life&rsquo;, he says, for he is a giver of life. &lsquo;Thou art giver of radiance, O Agni; give me radiance&rsquo;, he says, for he is a giver of radiance. I Thou art guardian of the body, O Agni; guard my body&rsquo;, he says [4], for he is a guardian of the body. &lsquo;O Agni, whatever is deficient in my body, do thou make that good for me&rsquo;, he says; &lsquo;whatever is deficient in my offspring and cattle, do thou make that good for me&rsquo;, be says in effect. &lsquo;O thou of various splendour, in safety may I reach the end of thee&rsquo;, he says; that of various splendour is the night. The Brahmans aforetime feared its not dawning; verily he wins the dawn. &lsquo;Kindling thee for a hundred winters&rsquo; [5], he says; man lives a hundred years and has a hundred powers; verily he rests on life and power. This is a pipe with projections; by it the gods made piercings of hundreds of the Asuras; in that he takes up the kindling-stick with this verse, the sacrificer hurls the hundred-slaying (verse) as a bolt against his enemy to lay (him) low without fail. &lsquo;Thou, O Agni, hast attained the radiance of the sun&rsquo;, he says; &rsquo;that thou art, thus may I be&rsquo;, he says in effect. &lsquo;Thou, O Agni, hast the radiance of the sun&rsquo;, he says; verily he invokes this blessing.</p>
<h2 id="08">08</h2>
<p>&lsquo;I gaze on offspring&rsquo;, he says; verily he wins all the domesticated animals. &lsquo;Ye are water; may I share your water&rsquo;, he says, for they are water. &lsquo;Ye are greatness; may I share your greatness&rsquo;, he says, for they are greatness. &lsquo;Ye are might; may I share your might&rsquo;, he says, for they are might. &lsquo;Ye are strength; may I share your strength&rsquo;, he says [1], for they are strength. &lsquo;Ye wealthy ones, stay&rsquo;, he says; the wealthy ones are cattle; verily he makes cattle stay with himself. &lsquo;Be ye here; go not hence&rsquo;, he says; verily he makes them constant, departing not. Now one fire is piled with bricks, one with cattle. &lsquo;Thou art composed Of every form&rsquo;, (with these words) he strokes the calf; verily he piles it up and makes it piled with cattle. He falls away [2] from this world who pays reverence to the Ahavaniya; he pays reverence to the Garhapatya; verily he rests on this world, and also he makes amends to the Garhapatya. He pays reverence with Gayatri verses; the Gayatri is brilliance; verily he confers brilliance upon himself; moreover in that he repeats the triad (of verses), (it serves) for continuity. Because of the Garhapatya men are born with two feet; to him who knowing thus pays reverence to the Garhapatya with (verses) of two feet [3], a hero son is born. &lsquo;With strength I gaze upon you; gaze on me with strength&rsquo;, he says; verily he invokes this blessing. &lsquo;That excellent glory of Savitr&rsquo;, he says, for instigation. &lsquo;Famous the Soma-presser&rsquo;, he says; verily he wins the Soma draught. &lsquo;Make, O lord of prayer&rsquo;, he says; verily he wins splendour. &lsquo;Never art thou barren&rsquo;, be says; no barren night does he pass [4], who knowing thus pays reverence to the fire. May we (set) thee around, O Agni, as a fort&rsquo;, he says; verily he sets around a barrier, that nothing be spilt. &lsquo;O Agni, lord of the house&rsquo;, he says; that is according to the text. &lsquo;For a hundred winters&rsquo;, he says; &lsquo;for a hundred winters may I kindle thee&rsquo;, he says in effect. He utters the name of his son; verily he makes him an eater of food. &lsquo;This blessing I invoke bringing light for the race&rsquo;, he should say, who has no son born; verily is born to him a son brilliant and resplendent. &lsquo;This blessing I invoke bringing light for N. N.&rsquo;, he should say who has a son born; verily he confers upon him brilliance and splendour.</p>

<p>He offers the Agnihotra; whatever there is. of the Sacrificer&rsquo;s own, that is (still) his. In the generative organ he pours seed, for Agni is the generative organ. Then he burns at the end the plants; they then grow more numerous. In that he offers in the evening, he thus pours seed, and</p>
<p>makes it productive by the morning (offering). Seed when poured does not prove fruitful unless modified by Tvastr; as many modifications of seed when poured [1] as Tvastr makes, in so many shapes does it become fruitful; the sacrificer is the divine Tvastr. He pays reverence with many (verses); verily he makes many modifications of the seed when poured. He is fruitful and day by day becomes greater, who knowing thus pays reverence to the fire. The day was the gods&rsquo;, the night the Asuras&rsquo;. The Asuras entered night with all the precious wealth of the gods [2]; the gods thought that they were abandoned; they perceived, &lsquo;The night is Agni&rsquo;s, cattle are Agni&rsquo;s; verily let us praise Agni here; he being praised by us will restore our cattle.&rsquo; They praised Agni; be praised by them delivered their cattle from night to day; the gods having gained their cattle per formed their desires. He who knowing thus pays reverence to the fire becomes possessed of cattle [3]. The sun went from this world to yonder world; he having gone to yonder world bethought him again of this world; having returned to this world he had fear of death, for this world is, as it were, yoked with death. He reflected, &lsquo;Let me praise Agni here; he, praised, will make me go to the world of heaven.&rsquo; He praised Agni; he, praised, made him go to the world of heaven. He who [4] knowing thus pays reverence to the fire, goes to the world of heaven and lives all his days. He mounts these two fires who pays reverence to them; he acts according to the desires of one who has attained a higher place. He pays reverence at night, not in the morning, for vows are mingled at night, the bad and the good are on the same level, the fire is the light, the evening is the darkness; in that [5] he pays reverence by night, he overcomes the darkness by light. &lsquo;Should reverence be paid to the fire or not?&rsquo; they say; &lsquo;he who day by day makes a present to a man and then begs of him assuredly molests him; and who then will day by day beg of the gods?&rsquo; Then they say, &lsquo;The sacrificer sacrifices for the sake of the benediction.&rsquo; The reverence of the fire is [6] the benediction of him who has established a fire; therefore reverence should be paid to the fire. Prajapati created cattle; being created they entered day and night; he recovered them by means of the metres. In that he pays reverence with the metres, he seeks to recover his own. &lsquo;There is not monotony then&rsquo;, they say, &lsquo;if one pays reverence day by day.&rsquo; If a man pays reverence to the fire facing it, it burns him; if with averted (face), he is deprived of offspring and cattle; he should pay reverence with (face) somewhat to the side, then (the fire) does not burn him, he is not deprived of offspring or cattle.</p>

<p>Agni, the priest, I summon hither;<br>
The gods worthy of sacrifice whom we invoke,<br>
Let these gods come in kindly mind;<br>
Let the gods enjoy this oblation of me.</p>
<h3 id="k-3">k</h3>
<p>Who yoketh thee? Let him yoke thee.</p>
<h3 id="l-3">l</h3>
<p>The potsherds for the cauldron [3],<br>
Which wise men collect,<br>
These are in Pusan&rsquo;s guardianship;<br>
Indra and Vayu set them free.</p>
<h3 id="m-2">m</h3>
<p>Unbroken is the cauldron, sprinkling abundantly,<br>
It hath returned to that whence it came;<br>
The kindling-wood, the Vedi, and all the enclosing-sticks<br>
Attend the life of the sacrifice.</p>
<h3 id="n-2">n</h3>
<p>The three and thirty threads that stretch,<br>
That maintain in security the sacrifice,<br>
Of these the broken one I restore; hail!<br>
Let the cauldron go to the gods.</p>
<h2 id="11">11</h2>
<h3 id="a-3">a</h3>
<p>Let Vaiśvanara with succour for us<br>
Come from afar,<br>
Agni through the hymn which brings (him).</p>
<h3 id="b-4">b</h3>
<p>The righteous Vaiśvanara,<br>
Lord of right and of light,<br>
The immortal cauldron we seek.&rsquo;</p>
<h3 id="c-4">c</h3>
<p>A greater than the marvels of Vaiśvanara<br>
By his craftsmanship the sage hath performed alone;<br>
Magnifying both parents, sky and earth,<br>
Rich in seed, was Agni born.</p>
<h3 id="d-4">d</h3>
<p>Desired in the sky, Agni, desired on earth,<br>
Desired he entereth all the plants;<br>
Agni Vaiśvanara eagerly desired,<br>
May he by day [1] and night protect us from the foe.</p>
<h3 id="e-4">e</h3>
<p>In that, when born, O Agni, thou didst survey the worlds,<br>
Like a busy herd that goeth around his flock,<br>
Do thou, O Vaiśvanara, find a way for the Brahman;<br>
Do ye protect us ever with your blessings.</p>
<h3 id="f-4">f</h3>
<p>Thou, O Agni, blazing with light,<br>
Didst fill the firmament at thy birth;<br>
Thou, O Vaiśvanara, wise one, by thy might<br>
Didst free the gods from misfortune.&rsquo;</p>
<h3 id="g-4">g</h3>
<p>O Agni, among our bountiful lords, preserve<br>
The lordship, uninjured, unageing, rich in heroes;<br>
May we win booty a hundred, a thousandfold,<br>
O Vaiśvanara [2], O Agni, through thy help.</p>
<h3 id="h-4">h</h3>
<p>May we enjoy the loving kindness of Vaiśvanara,<br>
For he is the king, the orderer of the worlds<br>
Hence born be discerneth all the (earth),<br>
Vaiśvanara vieth with the sun.</p>
<h3 id="i-4">i</h3>
<p>Thine anger, O Varuna, would we avert with reverence,<br>
With sacrifices, with oblations<br>
Ruling, O wise Asura, O king,<br>
Do thou unloose the sins we have committed.</p>
<h3 id="k-4">k</h3>
<p>Unloose from us, O Varuna, the highest,<br>
The lowest, the midmost knot;<br>
Then may we, O Aditya [3], in thy rule,<br>
Be guiltless before Aditi.<br>
I Of Dadhikravan have I sung,<br>
The swift strong horse;<br>
May he make our mouths fragrant;<br>
May he lengthen our days.</p>
<h3 id="m-3">m</h3>
<p>Dadhikra with his glory hath overspread the five peoples,<br>
As the sun with his light the waters;<br>
May the strong steed, winning a hundred, a thousand,<br>
Fill with boney these words of ours.</p>
<h3 id="n-3">n</h3>
<p>Agni, the head.</p>
<h3 id="o-2">o</h3>
<p>Thou art.</p>
<h3 id="p-2">p</h3>
<p>O Maruts, what time seeking your favour<br>
We call on you from the sky,<br>
Do ye come unto us [4].</p>
<h3 id="q-2">q</h3>
<p>The protections which ye have for the earnest worshipper,<br>
Threefold do ye grant them to the generous giver,<br>
To us, O Maruts, do ye accord them;<br>
O strong ones, give us wealth rich in heroes:</p>
<h3 id="r-1">r</h3>
<p>Let Aditi save us,<br>
Let Aditi give us protection,<br>
Let Aditi guard us from tribulation.</p>
<h3 id="s-1">s</h3>
<p>The mighty mother of the righteous,<br>
The spouse of holy order, let us invoke to aid us,<br>
The powerful, the unageing, the wide<br>
Aditi, who giveth good protection and good guidance.</p>
<h3 id="t">t</h3>
<p>Earth strong to save, sky unrivalled,<br>
Aditi who giveth good protection and good guidance,<br>
The divine ship with good oars, the blameless,<br>
Which leaketh not, let us mount for prosperity.</p>
<h3 id="u">u</h3>
<p>Happily have I mounted this ship<br>
With a hundred oars and a hundred spars,<br>
Without leak, able to convey across.</p>
