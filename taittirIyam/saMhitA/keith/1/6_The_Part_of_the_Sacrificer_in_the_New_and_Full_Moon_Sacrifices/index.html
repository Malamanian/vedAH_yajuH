<p>Even as the Soma (sacrifices) come together in competition, so the new and full moon (sacrifices) are sacrifices which come together in competition. Whose sacrifice then do the gods approach and whose not? He, who among many sacrificers first appropriates the gods, sacrifices to them when the next day comes. The Ahavaniya is the abode of the gods, between the fires of cattle, the Garhapatya of men, the Anvaharya pacana of the fathers. He takes the fire; verily he appropriates [1] the gods in their own abode; to them he sacrifices when the next day comes. By means of a vow is Agni, lord of vows, pure, the Brahman is a supporter of vows. When about to undertake a vow he should say, &lsquo;O Agni, lord of vows, I shall perform the vow.&rsquo; Agni is the lord of vows among the gods; verily after announcement to him he undertakes the vow. At the full moon be undertakes his vow with the (strewing of the) straw, with the (driving away of the) calves at new moon; for that is their abode. &lsquo;The fires, both in the front and at the back, must be bestrewed&rsquo;, they say; men [2] indeed desire what is bestrewed, and, how much more the gods whose is a new dwelling. With him, when sacrifice is to be made on the next day, do the gods dwell, who knowing this bestrews the fire. &lsquo;The sacrificer should win both beasts of the wild and of the village&rsquo;, they say; in that he refrains from those of the village, thereby be wins them; in that he eats of the wild, thereby he wins them of the wild. If be were to fast without eating, the Pitrs would be his divinity [3]; he eats of the wild, the wild is power, and so he bestows power upon himself. If he were to fast without eating, he would be hungry; if he were to eat, Rudra would plan evil against his cattle; he partakes of water; that is neither eaten nor not eaten; he is not hungry and Rudra does not plot evil against his cattle. The sacrificer is a bolt, the enemy of man is hunger; in that he fasts without eating, he straightway smites with the bolt the enemy, hunger.</p>
<h2 id="08">08</h2>
<p>He who offers sacrifice without faith, they place not faith in his sacrifice. He brings waters forward, the waters are faith; verily with faith he offers sacrifice, and both gods and men place faith in his sacrifice. They say, &lsquo;They foam over the barrier, they foam over speech, but over mind they do not foam.&rsquo; He brings them forward with mind; mind is this (earth) [1]; verily with this (earth) he brings them forward. The sacrifice of him who knows thus does not spill. He collects the weapons of the sacrifice; the weapons of the sacrifice are the sacrifice; verily he collects the sacrifice. If he were to collect them one by one, they would have the Pitrs as their divinity; if all together, (they would have) men as their divinity. He collects them in pairs, and so he makes the form of the Yajya and the Anuvakya, and thus there is a pair. If a man knows the ten weapons of the sacrifice, his sacrifice</p>
<p>is in order at the beginning. The wooden sword [2], the potsherds, the offering-spoon, the basket, the black antelope skin, the pin, the mortar and pestle, the lower and upper millstones, these are the ten weapons of the sacrifice; the sacrifice of him who knows thus is in order at the beginning. If a man sacrifices after announcing the sacrifice to the gods, they delight in his sacrifice. He should as the oblation is being offered recite (the words), &lsquo;Agni, the priest, him I summon hither&rsquo; [3]. Thus he announces the sacrifice to the gods and sacrifices, and the gods delight in his sacrifice. This is the taking of the sacrifice and so after taking the sacrifice he sacrifices. After speaking he remains silent, to support the sacrifice. Now Prajapati performed the sacrifice with mind; verily he performs the sacrifice with mind to prevent the Raksases following. He who yokes the sacrifice when the yoking (time) arrives yokes it indeed among the yokers. &lsquo;Who (ka) yoketh thee? Let him yoke thee&rsquo;, he says. Ka is Prajapati&ndash;verily by Prajapati he yokes it; he yokes indeed among the yokers.</p>
<h2 id="09">09</h2>
<p>Prajapati created the sacrifices, the Agnihotra, the Agnistoma, the full moon sacrifice, the Ukthya, the new moon sacrifice and the Atiratra. These he meted out; the Agnistoma was the size of the Agnihotra, the Ukthya that of the full moon sacrifice, the Atiratra that of the new moon sacrifice. He who knowing thus offers the Agnihotra obtains as much as by offering the Agnistoma; he who knowing thus offers the full moon sacrifice obtains as much as by offering the Ukthya [1]; he who knowing thus offers the new moon sacrifice obtains as much as by offering the Atiratra. This sacrifice was in the beginning Paramesthin&rsquo;s, and by means of it he reached the supreme goal. He furnished Prajapati with it, and by means of it Prajapati reached the supreme goal. He furnished Indra with it, and by means of it Indra reached the supreme goal. He furnished Agni and Soma with it, and by means of it Agni and Soma reached the supreme goal. He who [2] knowing thus offers the new and full moon sacrifices reaches the supreme goal. He who sacrifices with an abundant offering is multiplied with offspring, with cattle, with pairings. &lsquo;The year has twelve months, there are twelve pairs of new and full moon sacrifices; these are to be produced&rsquo;, they say. He lets the calf go free and puts the pot on the fire: he puts down (the rice), and beats the millstones together; he scatters (the grains) and collects the potsherds; the cake [3] he puts on the fire and the melted butter; he throws the clump of grass, and gathers it in; he surrounds the Vedi and he girds the wife (of the sacrificer); he puts in place the anointing waters and the melted butter. These are the twelve pairs in the new and full moon sacrifices. He, who thus sacrifices with these, sacrifices with an abundant offering and is multiplied with offspring, with cattle, with pairings.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thou I art secure; may I be secure among my equals&rsquo;, he says; verily he makes them secure.&rsquo; &lsquo;Thou art dread; may I be dread among my equals&rsquo;; verily he makes them harmonious. &lsquo;Thou art overcoming; may I be overcoming among my equals,&rsquo; he says; verily he overthrows him who rises against him. &lsquo;I yoke thee with the divine Brahman&rsquo;, he says; this is the yoking of the fire; verily [1] with it he yokes it. With the prosperous part of the sacrifice the gods went to the world of heaven, with the unsuccessful part they overcame the Asuras. &lsquo;Whatever, O Agni, in this sacrifice of mine may be spoiled&rsquo;, he says; verily with the prosperous part of the sacrifice the sacrificer goes to the world of heaven, with the unsuccessful part he overcomes the foes. With these Vyahrtis he should set down the Agnihotra. The Agnihotra is the beginning of the sacrifice, these Vyahrtis are the Brahman; verily at the beginning of the sacrifice he makes the Brahman [2]. When the year is completed he should thus with these (Vyahrtis) perform the setting down; verily with the Brahman he surrounds the year on both sides. He who is undertaking the new and full moon and the four monthly offerings should set in place the oblations with these Vyahrtis. The new and full moon and the four monthly sacrifices are the beginning of the sacrifice, these Vyahrtis are the Brahman; verily at the beginning of the sacrifice he makes the Brahman. When the year is completed, he should thus with them (Vyahrtis) set down (the oblations), and so with the Brahman he surrounds the year on both sides. To the kingly class falls the blessing of the part of the sacrifice which is performed with the Saman [3]; to the people (falls) the blessing of what (is performed) with the Rc; now the Brahman sacrifices with an offering without a blessing; when he is about to recite the kindling-</p>

<p>He who knows the seventeenfold Prajapati as connected with the sacrifice rests secure through the sacrifice, and falls not away from the sacrifice. &lsquo;Do thou proclaim&rsquo; has four syllables; &lsquo;Be it proclaimed&rsquo; has four syllables; &lsquo;Utter&rsquo; has two syllables; &lsquo;We that do utter&rsquo; has five syllables; the Vasat has two syllables; this is the seventeenfold Prajapati as connected with the sacrifice; he who knows thus rests secure through the sacrifice and does not fall away from the sacrifice. He who knows the beginning, the support, the end of the sacrifice [1] reaches the end with a secure and uninjured sacrifice. &lsquo;Do thou proclaim&rsquo;; &lsquo;Be it proclaimed&rsquo;; &lsquo;Utter&rsquo;; &lsquo;We that do utter&rsquo;; the Vasat call, these are the beginning, the support, the end of the sacrifice; he who knows thus reaches the end with a secure and uninjured sacrifice. He who knows the milking of the generous one milks her indeed. The generous one is the sacrifice; (with the words) &lsquo;Do thou proclaim&rsquo;, he calls her; with &lsquo;Be it proclaimed&rsquo; [2], he lets (the calf) go up to her; with &lsquo;Utter&rsquo;, he raises (the pail); with &lsquo;We that do utter&rsquo;, he sits down beside her, and with the Vasat call he milks. This is the milking of the generous one; he who knows thus milks her indeed. The gods performed a sacrificial session; the quarters were dried up; they discerned this moist set of five; (with the words) &lsquo;Do thou proclaim&rsquo;, they produced the east wind; with &lsquo;Be it proclaimed&rsquo;, they caused the clouds to mass together; with &lsquo;Utter&rsquo; they begat [3] the lightning; with &lsquo;We that do sacrifice&rsquo; they made rain to fall, and with the Vasat call they caused the thunder to roll. Then for them the quarters were made to swell; for him who knows thus the quarters are made to swell. One knows Prajapati, Prajapati knows one; whom Prajapati knows, he becomes pure. This is the Prajapati of the texts, &lsquo;Do thou proclaim&rsquo;, &lsquo;Be it proclaimed&rsquo;, &lsquo;Utter&rsquo;, &lsquo;We that do utter&rsquo;, the Vasat call; he who knows thus becomes pure. &lsquo;Of the seasons spring [4] I delight&rsquo;, he says; the fore-sacrifices are the seasons; verily he delights the seasons; they delighted place themselves in order for him; the seasons are in order for him who knows thus. &lsquo;By sacrifice to the gods, Agni and Soma, may I be possessed of sight&rsquo;, he says; the sacrifice is possessed of sight through Agni and Soma; verily by means of them he confers sight upon himself. &lsquo;By sacrifice to the god Agni, may I be an eater of food&rsquo;, he says; Agni is among the gods the eater of food; verily by means of him [5] he confers the eating of food upon himself. &lsquo;Thou art a deceiver; may I be undeceived; may I deceive N. N.&rsquo;, he says; by that deceit the gods deceived the Asuras; verily by this he deceives his foe. &lsquo;By sacrifice to the gods, Agni and Soma, may I be a slayer of foes&rsquo;, he says; by means of Agni and Soma Indra slew Vrtra; verily by means of them he lays low his foe. &lsquo;By sacrifice to the gods, Indra and Agni, may I be powerful and an eater of food&rsquo;, he says; verily he becomes powerful and an eater of food. &lsquo;By sacrifice to the god Indra, may I be powerful&rsquo;, he says; verily he becomes powerful. &lsquo;By sacrifice to the god Mahendra, may I attain superiority and greatness&rsquo;, he says; verily he attains superiority and greatness. &lsquo;By sacrifice to the god Agni Svistakrt, may I attain security through the sacrifice, enjoying long life&rsquo;, he says; verily he confers long life upon himself and attains security through the sacrifice.</p>
