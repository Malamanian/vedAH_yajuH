      <description>01 a By the Yajus I pour on thee
Offspring, life, and wealth.
Instigated by Brhaspati may the sacrificer here come to no harm.
b Thou art butter, thou art truth, thou art the overseer of truth, thou art the oblation of Vaiśvanara, of the All-gods, with pure strength, of true might; thou art power, overpowering; overpower hostility, overpower those who practise hostility; overpower enmity, overpower those who practise emnity; thou art of a thousandfold strength; do thou quicken me; thou art of butter the butter; thou art of truth the truth; thou hast true life [1]; thou hast true strength; with truth I besprinkle thee; may I share thee that art such.</description>

      <description>i-7-1-Cattle attend the cooked offerings of him who has established a fire-The cooked offering is the Ida; it is placed in the world of the sacrifice between the fore- and the after-offerings-Over it as it is brought up he should say, &amp;lsquo;O thou of fair rain colour, come hither&amp;rsquo;; the cattle are the Ida; verily he summons cattle-The gods milked the sacrifice, the sacrifice milked the Asuras; the Asuras, being milked by the sacrifice, were defeated; he, who knowing the milking of the sacrifice [1] sacrifices, milks another sacrificer-&amp;lsquo;May the blessing of this sacrifice be fulfilled for me&amp;rsquo;, he says; this is the milking of the sacrifice; verily with it he milks it-The cow is milked willingly, and willingly the Ida is milked for the sacrificer; these are the teats of Ida, &amp;lsquo;Ida is invoked&amp;rsquo;-Vayu is the calf-When the Hotr summons the Ida, then the sacrificer looking at the Hotr should in mind reflect on Vayu [2]; verily he lets the calf go to the mother-By the whole sacrifice the gods went to the world of heaven; Manu laboured with the cooked offering; the Ida went to Manu; the gods and the Asuras called severally upon her, the gods directly, the Asuras indirectly; she went to the gods; the cattle choose the gods, cattle deserted the Asuras-If he desire of a man, &amp;lsquo;May he be without cattle&amp;rsquo;, he should invoke the Ida indirectly for him; verily he becomes without cattle [3]-If he desire of a man, &amp;lsquo;May he be rich in cattle&amp;rsquo;, he should invoke the Ida directly for him; verily he becomes rich in cattle-The theologians say, &amp;lsquo;He would invoke the Ida indeed who in invoking the Ida should invoke himself in the Ida.</description>

      <description>01 a Anumati he offers a cake on eight potsherds; the sacrificial fee is a cow. The (grains) which are thrown down to the west of the support he (offers) on one potsherd to Nirrti; the sacrificial fee is a black garment with a black fringe.
Go away, hail! rejoicing in the oblation.
This is thy share, O Nirrti;
O thou who hast prospered, thou art rich in oblation;
Free him from evil.</description>
