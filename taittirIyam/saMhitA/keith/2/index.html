He who desires offspring should offer to Soma a brown (beast), and to Agni one with a black neck; Soma [7] is the depositor of seed, Agni the producer of offspring; verily Soma deposits seed for him, Agni produces offspring; he obtains offspring.

Indra departs with his [1] power, Varuna seizes him with Varuna&rsquo;s noose, who is seized by evil; for him who is seized by evil, he should offer this (offering of) clotted milk to Indra and Varuna; verily Indra bestows power upon him, Varuna frees him from Varuna&rsquo;s noose. (The offering) is of clotted</p>
<p>milk, for milk departs from him; verily he is seized with evil; in that it is of clotted milk, thereby he bestows milk upon him. In the clotted milk [2] he puts down the cake; verily he makes him possessed of a body, and also possessed of an abode. He separates it into four pieces; verily he finds supports in the quarters; he unites (the fires) again; verily he procures healing for him from the quarters; having united (them) he cuts off (portions); that is as when one cuts up what has been pierced. (That disease of yours, O Indra and Varuna, that is in the fire, that of yours I appease hereby&rsquo;, he says; verily he protects him from error in sacrifice. &lsquo;That disease of yours, O Indra and Varuna, that is in the two footed cattle, that of yours I appease hereby&rsquo;, he says; so many are the waters, the plants, the trees, offspring and cattle on whom to live; verily does he free them for him from Varuna&rsquo;s noose.</p>

<p>The gods, men, and the Pitrs were on one side, the Asuras, Raksases, and Piśacas on the other. Of the gods the little blood they drew the Raksases smothered by the nights and dawn dawned on them smothered and dead. The gods understood, &lsquo;Him who of us dies, it is the Raksases who kill.&rsquo; They invited the Raksases; they said, &lsquo;Let us choose a boon; what [1] we win from the Asuras, let that be shared between us.&rsquo; Then indeed did the gods conquer the Asuras, and having conquered the Asuras, they drove away the Raksases. The Raksases (saying), &lsquo;Ye have done falsely&rsquo;, surrounded the gods on all sides. The gods found a protector in Agni; they offered to Agni, the forward, a cake on eight potsherds, to Agni, the overcomer, to Agni with the face. In that they offered to Agni, the forward, the Raksases in front [2] they repelled thereby; in that (they offered) to Agni, the overcomer, the Raksases that were around they repelled thereby; in that (they offered) to Agni with the face, the Raksases behind were repelled thereby. That the gods prospered, the Raksases were defeated. He who has foes should in conflict sacrifice with this offering; he should offer to Agni, the forward, a cake on eight potsherds, to Agni, the overcomer [3], to Agni with the face. In that he offers to Agni, the forward, he repels thereby the foe who is superior to him; in that (he offers) to Agni, the overcomer, he repels thereby (the foe) who is equal to him; in that (he offers) to Agni with the face, he repels thereby the foe which is inferior to him. He repels the foe who is superior,</p>
<p>he surpasses him who is like, the inferior does not equal him who knowing thus sacrifices with this offering.</p>
<h3 id="02-3">02</h3>
<p>The gods and the Asuras were in conflict; the gods said, &lsquo;Let us hold on to the strongest of us&rsquo;; they said to Indra, &lsquo;Thou art the strongest of us; let us hold on to thee.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;Three are these forms of my own that have strength; satiate them, and then shall ye overcome the Asuras.&rsquo; They said, &lsquo;Name (them).&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;This is that which frees from tribulation; this is that which drives away the foe;<br>
this is that which has power&rsquo; [1]. They offered to Indra, the freer from tribulation, a cake on eleven potsherds, to Indra, the driver away of the foe, to Indra, the powerful. In that they offered to Indra, the freer from tribulation, thereby they were freed from tribulation; in that they offered to Indra, the driver away of foes, thereby they drove away foes; in that they offered to Indra, the powerful, thereby they bestowed power upon themselves. They offered a cake on thirty-three potsherds; the gods are thirty-three; verily Indra takes hold of them in himself, for prosperity [2]. That was the highest victory that the gods won over the Asuras. He who has foes should in conflict sacrifice with this offering; to Indra, the freer from tribulation, he should offer a cake on eleven potsherds, to Indra, the driver away of the foe, to Indra, the powerful; by tribulation is he seized whose foe is superior to him; in that he offers to Indra, the freer from tribulation, he is freed thereby from tribulation; by foes is he beset, to whom one of his equals is superior, even [3] if no foe; in that (he offers) to Indra, the driver away of the foe, he smites away thereby his foes; in that (he offers) to Indra, the powerful, he bestows thereby power upon himself; he offers a cake on thirty-three potsherds; the gods are thirty-three; verily the sacrificer takes hold of them in himself, for prosperity, Thus is the sacrifice called &rsquo;the victorious&rsquo;; he who knowing thus sacrifices with this offering wins thus the highest victory over his foe.</p>
<h3 id="03-3">03</h3>
<p>The gods and the Asuras were in conflict; the Gayatri, grasping and taking their force, might, power, strength, offspring, and cattle, remained away; they reflected, I Whomsoever of us she shall resort to, they shall become this (world)&rsquo;; they hailed her in rivalry, &lsquo;O All worker&rsquo;, said the gods; &lsquo;O Deceiver&rsquo;, said the Asuras; neither did she resort to. The gods saw this formula, &lsquo;Thou art force, thou art strength, thou art might [1], thou are blazing, thou art by name the home of the gods, thou art all, of all life thou art everything, thou art of every life, the overcoming.&rsquo; (So saying) the gods appropriated the force, might, power, strength, offspring, and cattle of the Asuras. Because the Gayatri remained away, therefore they style this offering the Gayatri; the Gayatri is the year, so the year remained away; because the gods thereby appropriated the force, might, power, strength [2], offspring, and cattle of the Asuras, therefore they style this offering the gatherer. He who has foes should in conflict sacrifice with this offering. To Agni, the gatherer, he should offer a cake on eight potsherds; this when cooked and put in place he should stroke with this formula; verily he appropriates the force, might, power, strength, offspring, and cattle of his foe; he prospers with himself, his foe is defeated.</p>
<h3 id="04-3">04</h3>
<p>Prajapati created offspring; they created went away from him; where they stayed, thence sprung the bean. Those he followed with Brhaspati; Brhaspati said, &lsquo;With this will I go before thee, then shall offspring have resort to thee.&rsquo; He went before him; then indeed did offspring resort to Prajapati. For him who desires offspring he should offer this oblation of beans to Prajapati verily he has recourse to Prajapati with his own share [1]; verily he produces offspring for him. Prajapati created cattle; they created went away from him; where they stayed, thence sprung the bean; those he followed with Pusan; Pusan said, &lsquo;With this do thou go before me; then shall cattle resort to thee.&rsquo; &lsquo;Do thou go before me&rsquo;, said Soma, &lsquo;mine [2] is what grows on untilled (land).&rsquo; &lsquo;Both of you shall I go before&rsquo;, he said; he went before them both; then indeed did cattle resort to Prajapati. For him who desires cattle should he offer this oblation of beans to Soma and Pusan; verily he has recourse to Soma and Pusan</p>
<p>with their own share; verily they produce cattle for him. Soma is the impregnator of seed, Pusan the producer of cattle; verily Soma bestows seed upon him, Pusan produces cattle.</p>

<p>He who desires cattle should sacrifice with the Çitra (offering); Çitra is this (earth); in that in this (earth) all things are produced, thereby is this (earth) variegated (citra); he who knowing thus sacrifices with the Çitra desirous of cattle is propagated with offspring, with cattle, with pairings. With the offering to Agni he strews, with that to Soma he impregnates seed, the seed impregnated Tvastr develops into forms; there are (offerings) to Sarasvant and Sarasvati; that is the divine pair; verily in the midst he bestows upon him a divine [1] pair, for growth, for propagation. There is an oblation to Sinivali; Sinivali is speech, speech is growth; verily he approaches speech and growth. The last is to Indra, and thereby there is a pair. Seven are these offerings, the tame animals are seven, the wild seven; the metres are seven, for the winning of both.

<p>&lsquo;Thou art connected with the Maruts, thou art the force of the Maruts&rsquo;, (with these words) he puts on a black garment with a black fringe; that is the hue of rain; verily becoming of like hue he causes Parjanya to rain. &lsquo;Stay, O Maruts, the speeding falcon&rsquo;, (with these words) he pushes back the west wind; verily he produces the east wind, to win the rains. He makes offering to the names of the wind; the wind rules the rain; verily he has recourse to the wind with its own share; verily it makes Parjanya rain for him. Eight offerings [1] he makes; the quarters are four, the intermediate quarters are four; verily from the quarters he makes the rain to move. He unites (them) on a black antelope skin; verily he makes the offering; he unites within the Vedi, for accomplishment. When the Yatis were being eaten, their heads fell away; they became Kharjuras; their sap rose upwards, they became Kariras; the Kariras are connected with Soma; the offering connected with Soma makes rain to move from the sky; in that there are Kariras (in the sacrifice) [2], by means of an offering which is connected with Soma he wins the rain from the sky. With honey he unites (them); honey is the sap of the waters and the plants; verily it rains from the waters and the plants; verily also he brings down rain from the waters and the plants. &lsquo;Gladdening, obedient&rsquo;, (with these words) he unites (them); verily he approaches them by their names; just as one may say, &lsquo;Come hither, N. N.&rsquo;, so by their names [3] he makes them move forward. Thou art the fetter of the strong horse; for rain I yoke thee&rsquo;, he says the horse is strong, Parjanya is strong; becoming black as it were he rains; verily he unites him with his hue, to win the rains.</p>

<p>&lsquo;O gods having wealth, O gods granting protection, O gods drinking together&rsquo;, (with these words) he ties on; verily by means of the gods he daily seeks rain. If it should rain, so much only should be offered; if it should not rain, on the next day he should offer an oblation. Mitra and Varuna are day and night, by day and night Parjanya rains, for by night or by day he rains; verily he has recourse to Mitra and Varuna with their own share; verily they [1] make Parjanya rain for him by day and night. To Agni, hiding his abode, he should offer a cake on eight potsherds, to the Maruts on seven potsherds, to Surya on one potsherd; Agni thence causes the rain to arise, the Maruts lead it out when produced; when yonder Sun Moves low with his rays, then he rains; becoming a hider of his abode, as it were, he rains; these deities are the lords of rain; them he has recourse to with their own share; they [2] make Parjanya rain for him; even if he is not minded to rain yet he rains. &lsquo;Let free the rain from heaven; with waters fill the ocean&rsquo;, he says; verily these and yonder waters he unites; then with these he approaches yonder (waters). &lsquo;Thou art born of waters, first-born; thou art the might of the ocean&rsquo;, he says; that is according to the text. &lsquo;Flood the earth&rsquo;, (with these words) he offers in a Boerhavia procumbens; this of plants is that which wins rain, and thereby he causes rain to fall. &lsquo;The gods whose portion is in the sky&rsquo;, (with these words) he shakes the black antelope skin; verily to him these worlds become dear and desired.</p>

<p>&lsquo;All&rsquo; the metres are to be recited in this sacrifice&rsquo;, they say; the Kakubh is the strength of the Tristubh, the Usnih of the Jagati; in that he repeats the Usnih and the Kakubh, thereby he wins all the metres. The Usnih is the Gayatri; the four syllables over are fourfooted cattle; just as cake is over cake, so it is with the syllables which are over the verse; if he were to close with a Jagati [1], he would end the sacrifice; he closes with a Tristubh, the Tristubh is power and strength; verily he establishes the sacrifice on power and strength, he does not end it. &lsquo;O Agni, three are thy strengths, three thy abodes&rsquo;, with this (verse) containing the word &rsquo;three&rsquo; he closes, for similarity of form: that which has three constituents is the whole of the sacrifice; for every desire it is employed, for the sacrifice is employed for all desires. He who is practising witchcraft should sacrifice with that of three constituents; that which has three constituents is the whole of the sacrifice [2]; verily with the whole of the sacrifice he bewitches him, and lays him low. With the same (offering) should he sacrifice who is practised against, that which has three constituents is the whole of the sacrifice; verily he sacrifices with the whole of the sacrifice, and he who practises witchcraft does not lay him low. With the same (offering) should he sacrifice who is going to sacrifice with a thousand; verily he produces and gives (it). He who has sacrificed with a thousand should sacrifice with the same (offering) he goes to the end of cattle [3] who sacrifices with a thousand; Prajapati created cattle; he created them with (the offering) of three constituents; he who knowing thus sacrifices, desirous of cattle, with (the offering) of three constituents, creates cattle from the very source whence Prajapati created them; and the thousand resorts to him. He becomes a prey to the gods who having said, &lsquo;I shall sacrifice&rsquo;, does not sacrifice; he should sacrifice with (the offering) of three constituents; (the offering) of three constituents [4] is the whole of the sacrifice; verily he sacrifices with the whole of the sacrifice, and does not become a prey to the gods. The cake is on twelve potsherds; these are three (sets of) four potsherds, to bring about the three. There are three cakes, these worlds are three; (verily they serve) to win these worlds. Each one above the other is larger, for so as it were are these worlds. The middle one is made of barley, that is the form of the atmosphere; (verily it serves) for prosperity. He cuts off from all (the cakes) as he sets them up without making a failure. He gives gold; verily he wins brilliance [5]; he gives the silken garment; verily he wins cattle; he gives a cow; verily he wins his prayers; gold is the colour of the Saman, the silken garment of the formulae, the cow of the praises and rejoicings; verily he wins all these colours.</p>

<p>Tvastr, his son slain, offered Soma excluding Indra. Indra desired an invitation to the rite, but he did not invite him, (saying), &lsquo;Thou hast slain my son.&rsquo; He made a disturbance of the sacrifice, and forcibly drank the Soma. The remains of it Tvastr cast upon the Ahavaniya (fire), saying, &lsquo;Hail! wax great, Indra&rsquo;s foe. While (the fire) was flaming upwards to strike, just then of itself it stayed;</p>
<p>whether so much was before [1], or so much was over the fire, be sprang up alive and came into union with Agni and Soma. He grew on all sides an arrow(shot), he enveloped these worlds. Because he enveloped these worlds, therefore is Vrtra, Vrtra. Indra feared him, and Tvastr too; Tvastr dipped his bolt for him; the bolt was fervour; he could not restrain it. Visnu [2] was another god; he said, &lsquo;Visnu, come hither; we will grasp that by which he is this world. Visnu deposited himself in three places, a third on the earth, a third in the atmosphere, a third in the sky, for he was afraid of his growth. By means of the third on earth Indra raised his bolt, aided by Visnu. He said, &lsquo;Hurl it not at me; there is this [3] strength in me; I will give it to you.&rsquo; He gave it to him, he accepted it, and (saying), &lsquo;Thou didst further me&rsquo;, gave it to Visnu. Visnu accepted it (saying), &lsquo;Let Indra place power (indriya) in us.&rsquo; By means of the third in the atmosphere Indra raised his bolt, aided by Visnu. He said, &lsquo;Hurl it not at me; there is this [4] strength in me; I will give it to you.&rsquo; He gave it to him; he accepted it, and (saying), &lsquo;Twice hast thou furthered me&rsquo;, gave it to Visnu. Visnu accepted it (saying), &lsquo;Let Indra place power in us.&rsquo; By means of the third in the sky Indra raised his bolt, aided by Visnu. He said, &lsquo;Hurl it not at me; I will give to thee that by which I [5] am this world! He said, &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; (He replied), &lsquo;Let us make a compact; let me enter thee.&rsquo; &lsquo;If thou dost enter me, in what way wilt thou enjoy me?&rsquo; &lsquo;I will kindle thee; I will enter thee for thine enjoyment&rsquo;, he answered. Vrtra entered him. Vrtra is the belly; hunger is man&rsquo;s enemy; he who [6] knows this slays the enemy hunger. He gave it to him; he accepted it, and (saying), &lsquo;Thrice hast thou furthered me&rsquo;, gave it to Visnu. Visnu accepted it (saying), &lsquo;Let Indra place power in us.&rsquo; In that thrice he gave and thrice he accepted, that is the reason of the threefold character of the threefold. In that Visnu aided him and he gave (it) to Visnu, therefore the offering belongs to Indra and Visnu. Whatever there is here he gave to him, the Rces, the Samans, the Yajuses. A thousand he gave to him; therefore there are a thousand gifts.</p>

<p>The gods were afraid of the warrior on his birth. While still within (the womb) they fettered him with a bond. The warrior thus is born fettered; if he were born not fettered he would continually slay his foes. If one desire of a warrior, &lsquo;May he be born not fettered, may he continually slay his foes&rsquo;, one should offer for him the offering for Indra and Brhaspati, for the warrior is connected with Indra, Brhaspati is the holy power (Brahman); verily by the holy power (Brahman) he frees him from the bond that fetters him.

<p>Viśvarupa, son of Tvastr, was the domestic priest of the gods, and the sister&rsquo;s son of the Asuras. He had three heads, one which drank Soma, one Sura, and one which ate food. He promised openly the share to the gods, secretly to the Asuras. Men promise openly the share to every one; if they promise any one secretly, his share is indeed promised. Therefore Indra was afraid (thinking), &lsquo;Such an one is diverting the sovereignty (from me).&rsquo; He took his bolt and smote off his heads. (The head) which drank Soma [1] became a hazelcock; (the head) which drank Sura a sparrow; (the head) which ate food a partridge. He seized with his hand the guilt of slaying him, and bore it for a year. Creatures called out upon him, &lsquo;Thou art a Brahman slayer.&rsquo; He appealed to the earth, &lsquo;Take a third part of my guilt.&rsquo; She said, &lsquo;Let me choose a boon. I deem that I shall be overcome through digging. Let me not be overcome by that.&rsquo; He replied, &lsquo;Before [2] a year is out it will grow up for thee.&rsquo; Therefore before the year is out the dug-out portion of earth grows up again, for that was what she chose as a boon. She took a third of his guilt. That became a natural fissure; therefore one who has</p>
<p>piled up a fire-altar and whose deity is faith should not choose a natural fissure, for that is the colour of guilt. He appealed to the trees, &lsquo;Take a third part of my guilt.&rsquo; They said, &lsquo;Let us choose a boon. We deem that we shall be overcome through pruning [3]. Let us not be overcome by that.&rsquo; He replied, &lsquo;From pruning shall more (shoots) spring up for you.&rsquo; Therefore from the pruning of trees more (shoots) spring up, for that was what they chose as a boon. They took a third part of his guilt, it became sap; therefore one should not partake of sap, for it is the colour of guilt. Or rather of the sap which is red or which comes from the pruning one should not partake [4], but of other sap at will. He appealed to a concourse of women, &lsquo;Take the third of my guilt.&rsquo; They said, &lsquo;Let us choose a boon; let us obtain offspring from after the menses; let us enjoy intercourse at will up to birth.&rsquo; Therefore women obtain offspring from after the menses, and enjoy intercourse at will up to birth, for that was what they chose as a boon. They took a third of his guilt, it became (a woman) with stained garments; therefore one should not converse with (a woman) with stained garments [5], one should not sit with her, nor eat her food, for she keeps emitting the colour of guilt. Or rather they say, &lsquo;Woman&rsquo;s food is unguent, and there fore one should not accept (from her) unguent, but anything else (can be accepted) at will.&rsquo; The son born of intercourse with (a woman) with stained garments is accursed; (the son born) of intercourse in the forest is a thief; (the son born) of intercourse with a (woman) who turns away is shamefaced and retiring; (the son born) of intercourse with a woman bathing is fated to drown; (the son born) of one who [6] anoints herself has a skin disease; (the son born) of one who combs her hair is bald and feeble; (the son born) of one who anoints (her eyes) is blind; (the son born) of one who cleans her teeth has dirty teeth; (the son born) of one who cuts her nails has bad nails; (the son born) of one who spins is a eunuch; (the son born) of one who weaves ropes is unrestrained; (the son born) of one who drinks from a leaf is drunken; (the son born) of one who drinks from a mutilated (vessel) is mutilated. For three nights he should keep a vow and should drink from his hand or from a perfect vessel, to guard his offspring.</p>
<h3 id="02-4">02</h3>
<p>Tvastr, his son being slain, offered Soma excluding Indra. Indra desired an invitation to the rite, but he did not invite him; (saying) &lsquo;Thou hast slain my son.&rsquo; He made a disturbance of the sacrifice, and forcibly drank the Soma. The remains of it Tvastr cast upon the Ahavaniya (fire), (saying), &lsquo;Hail! wax great, Indra&rsquo;s foe.&rsquo; In that he cast it (avartayat), Vrtra is Vrtra; in that he said, &lsquo;Hail! wax great, Indra&rsquo;s foe&rsquo;, therefore [1] Indra became his foe. He sprang into life and came into union with Agni and Soma. He grew on all sides an arrow(shot), he enveloped these worlds. Because he enveloped these worlds, therefore is Vrtra, Vrtra. Indra feared him. He ran up to Prajapati, (saying), &lsquo;A foe has sprung up for me.&rsquo; He dipped his bolt and gave it to him, (saying), &lsquo;Slay with it.&rsquo; He went against (him) with it. Agni and Soma said, &lsquo;Hurl it not [2]; we are within.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ye are mine&rsquo;, he replied, &lsquo;come to me.&rsquo; They asked for a share; he gave them at the full moon this offering for Agni and Soma on eleven potsherds. They said, &lsquo;We are bitten all round, and cannot come.&rsquo; Indra produced from himself cold and fever heat; that was the origin of cold and fever heat. Him who knows thus the origin of cold and fever heat [3] neither cold nor fever heat slays. By them he led him on, and as he gaped Agni and Soma went forth from him. Then expiration and inspiration deserted him; skill is expiration, intelligence is inspiration; therefore one who gapes should say, &lsquo;Skill and intelligence (remain) in me&rsquo;; verily he places expiration and inspiration in himself and lives all his days. He, having called off the gods from. Vrtra offered at the full moon the oblation to the Vrtra slayer; they slay him at the full moon [4], but make him swell at the new moon; therefore verses are uttered at the full moon referring to the slaying of Vrtra, at the new moon referring to his increase. Having performed the oblation to the Vrtra slayer, he took his bolt and again went against (him). Sky and earth said, &lsquo;Hurl it not; he rests in us two.&rsquo; They said, &lsquo;Let us choose a boon.&rsquo; &lsquo;May I be adorned with the Naksatras&rsquo;, said yonder (sky); I May I be adorned with variegated things&rsquo;, said this (earth). Therefore yonder (sky) is adorned with the Naksatras, this (earth) with variegated things. He who knows thus the boon of sky and earth [5] attains a boon. Indra thus impelled by these two slew Vrtra. The gods having slain Vrtra said to Agni and Soma, &lsquo;Bear the offering for us.&rsquo; They said, &lsquo;We two have lost our brilliance, our brilliance is in Vrtra.&rsquo; They said, &lsquo;Who is there to go for it?&rsquo; &lsquo;The cow&rsquo;, they said, &lsquo;The cow is the friend of all.&rsquo; She said [6], &lsquo;Let me choose a boon; ye shall feed off both when they are in me.&rsquo; The cow brought the (brilliance); therefore they feed off both things that</p>
<p>are in the cow; ghee indeed is the brilliance of Agni, milk the brilliance of Soma. He who knows thus the brilliance of Agni and Soma becomes brilliant. The theologians say, &lsquo;What is the deity of the full moon (rite)?&rsquo; He should reply, &lsquo;Prajapati; by means of it he established his eldest son, Indra.&rsquo; Therefore they establish their eldest sons with wealth.</p>
<h3 id="03-4">03</h3>
<p>When Indra had slain Vrtra, his enemies threatened him. He saw this enemy-dispelling (oblation) to be offered subsequently at the full moon. He offered it, and with it drove away his enemies. In that the enemy-dispelling (oblation) is to be offered subsequently at the full moon, the sacrificer by it drives away his enemies. Indra, having slain Vrtra, lost the gods and his power. He saw the (offering) to Agni on eight potsherds at the new moon, and the curds for Indra [1]. He offered it, and by it he won the gods and his power. In that at the new moon there is (an offering) to Agni on eight potsherds, and curds for Indra, the sacrificer wins by it the gods and power. When Indra had slain Vrtra, his power and strength went into the earth; then the plants and roots were born. He ran up to Prajapati, (saying), &lsquo;Now that I have slain Vrtra, my power and strength [2] have gone into the earth; then the plants and roots have been born.&rsquo; Prajapati said to cattle, &lsquo;Collect it for him.&rsquo; The cattle collected it from the plants in themselves; they milked it. In that they collected it, has the collected oblation (sammayya) its name; in that they milked it, has fresh milk its name (pratidhuk). &lsquo;They have collected it; they have milked it; but it rests not in me&rsquo;, he said. &lsquo;Make it ready for him&rsquo; [3], he replied. They made it ready for him; they made power and strength rest in him; verily the ready (milk) has its name (śrta). &lsquo;They have collected it; they have milked it; they have made it ready; but it does not impel me&rsquo;, he said. &lsquo;Make it curds for him&rsquo;, he replied. They made it curds for him; that impelled (ahinot) him; verily curds (dadhi) has its name. The theologians say, &lsquo;One should offer curds first, for curds is made first&rsquo; [4]. One should disregard that and offer ready (milk) first; verily one places power and strength in him and later impels him by curds; and he proceeds in order (of production). If he curdles it with Putika plants or with bark, that is fit for Soma; if with jujubes, that is for the Raksases; if with rice grains, for the All-gods; if with rennet, for men; if with curds, that has Indra. He curdles it with curds [5] that it may have Indra. He curdles the remains of the Agnihotra, for the continuity of the sacrifice. Indra having slain Vrtra went to a great distance, thinking, &lsquo;I have sinned.&rsquo; The gods sought to start him. Prajapati said, I He who first finds him will have the first share.&rsquo; The Pitrs found him; therefore an offering is made to the Pitrs on the day before. He approached the new moon night; the gods met him, (saying), &lsquo;Our treasure to-day at home [6] dwells&rsquo;, for Indra is the treasure of the gods, and that is why the new moon night has its name (ama-vasya), &lsquo;home dwelling&rsquo;). The theologians say, What is the deity of the Samnayya?&rsquo; &lsquo;The All-gods&rsquo;, he should reply, for so the All-gods won that as their share.&rsquo; Or rather he should reply, &lsquo;Indra, for it was in healing Indra that they won it.&rsquo;</p>
<h3 id="04-4">04</h3>
<p>The theologians say, &lsquo;He would indeed offer the new and full moon (sacrifices) who should offer them with Indra.&rsquo; At the full moon there is the subsequent offering of the enemy-dispelling (oblation), and by it the full moon has Indra. There are curds for Indra at the new moon; verily the new moon has Indra. He who knowing thus offers,&rsquo; the new and full moon sacrifices, offers them with Indra, and day after day it becomes better for him who has so sacrificed. What the gods did at the sacrifice, the Asuras did. The gods [1] saw this offering, one on eleven potsherds for Agni and Visnu, an oblation for Sarasvati, an oblation for Sarasvant; after performing the full moon (sacrifice) they offered this. Then the gods prospered, the Asuras were defeated. He who has enemies should offer this offering after performing the full moon (sacrifice). With the full moon (sacrifice) he hurls the bolt at his enemy, with (the offering) to Agni and Visnu he appropriates the gods and the sacrifice of his enemy, his pairing cattle with (the offerings) to Sarasvati and Sarasvant. Whatever he has, all that [2] he appropriates. One should sacrifice at the full moon, if one has enemies, not at the new moon; having slain one&rsquo;s enemy one does not cause him to grow again. He who desires cattle should sacrifice with the Sakamprasthayiya. The man to whom they bring (any thing) in small measure is not himself pleased, and does not give to another. But he, to</p>
<p>whom they bring in large measure, is himself pleased, and gives to another. One should offer in full and large measure; Indra then being pleased delights him with offspring and cattle. He offers with a wooden vessel, for an earthenware one does not hold the offering. It is of Udumbara wood [3]; the Udumbara is strength, cattle are strength; verily by strength he wins for him strength and cattle. One should not sacrifice to, Mahendra, if one is not prosperous. The prosperous are three; a learned (Brahman), a village headman, and a warrior. Their deity is Mahendra. He who sacrifices beyond his own deity loses his own deity, and does not obtain another, and becomes worse. For a year one should sacrifice to Indra, for the vow extends not beyond the year; verily [4] his own deity, being sacrificed to, kindles him with prosperity and he becomes richer. After the year he should offer a cake on eight potsherds to Agni, lord of vows; verily for a year Agni, lord of vows, causes him to take up the vow who has slain his foe (vrtra). Thereafter he may sacrifice at will.</p>
<h3 id="05-4">05</h3>
<p>No one who is not a Soma sacrificer should offer the Samnayya. For the milk of him who is not a Soma sacrificer is imperfect, and if one who is not a Soma sacrificer offers the Samnayya he is a thief and does wrong, and (his milk) is poured forth in vain. A Soma sacrificer only should offer the Samnayya. Soma is milk, the Samnayya is milk; verily with milk he places milk in himself. The moon deprives him of offspring and cattle, and makes his enemy wax great on whose sacrifice when offered it rises in the east [1]. He should divide the rice grains into three parts; the mean size he should make into a cake on eight potsherds for Agni, the giver, the largest lie should give as a mess to Indra, the bestower, the smallest (he should give) as a mess in boiled (milk) to Visnu Çipivista. Agni thus generates offspring for him; Indra gives it in crease; Visnu is the sacrifice, and Çipi cattle; verily on the sacrifice and cattle he rests. He should not offer twice [2]. If he were to offer now with the first he would make a failure with the second; if with the second now, he would make a failure with the first; there is no offering at all and no sacrifice, for that cause a son is born shamefaced and retiring. One offering only should one make; a valiant son is born to him. One should disregard this and offer twice. With the first (offering) one grasps the mouth of the sacrifice, and sacrifices with the second. Verily one wins the gods with the first, power with the second; verily one conquers the world of the gods [3] with the first; the world of men with the second; he performs several forms of sacrifice. This offering is called &rsquo;the friendly&rsquo;; for him there is in this world prosperity on whom the moon rises in the west after he hag sacrificed on that day. He who desires heaven should sacrifice with the Daksayana sacrifice. On the full moon he should offer the Samnayya; on the new moon he should sacrifice with clotted curds for Mitra and Varuna. On the full moon (the Soma) is pressed for the gods; during this half-month it is pressed forth for them, and a cow for Mitra and Varuna is to be slaughtered for them at the new moon. In that [4] he sacrifices on the day before, he makes the sacrificial enclosure. In that he drives away the calves, he metes out the seat and the oblation holder. In that he sacrifices, he produces with the gods the pressing day. He drinks for the half-month Soma in carouse with the gods. In that he sacrifices at the new moon with clotted curds for Mitra and Varuna, the cow which is slaughtered for the gods becomes his also. He mounts upon the gods in truth who mounts upon their sacrifice [5]. Just as a great man who has attained (fortune) desires (and does), so he does. If he misses the mark he becomes worse; if he does not, he remains the same. One who desires distinction should sacrifice with it, for this sacrifice has a razor edge, and swiftly he becomes holy or perishes. His vow is: he shall not speak untruth; be shall not eat meat; he shall not approach for all a woman; they shall not clean his raiment with cleansing stuff; for all these things the gods do not do.</p>
<h3 id="06-4">06</h3>
<p>The new and the full moon (sacrifices) are the chariot of the gods. He, who having offered the new and the full moon (sacrifices) Sacrifices with Soma, rests in the chosen resting-place of the gods which is conspicuous for its chariot (tracks). The new and the full moons are the limbs and joints of the year; he who knowing thus offers the new and the full moon (sacrifices) thus unites the limbs and joints of the year. The new and the full moon are the eyes of the year; he who knowing thus offers the new and the full moon (sacrifices) thus sees with them along the world of heaven [1]. The</p>
<p>which the gods fare. The new and the full moons are the bay steeds of the gods; he who knowing thus offers the new and the full moon (sacrifices) carries to the gods with their two bay steeds [2] the offering. The new and the full moon (sacrifices) are the mouth of the gods; he who knowing thus offers the new and the full moon (sacrifices) manifestly sacrifices in the mouth of the gods. He who offers the new and the full moon sacrifices possesses an oblation holder. He offers the Agnihotra morn and evening, he offers the new and the full moon (sacrifices); on every day (the Soma) of those who have oblation holders is pressed. By him who knowing thus offers the new and the full moon (sacrifices) regarding himself as possessiug an oblation holder, everything is given as on the strew. The gods [3] could not find the suitable day for the sacrifice. They purified the new and full moons; the new and the full moon (sacrifices) are these pure and sacrificial (days). He who knowing thus offers the new and the full moon (sacrifices) offers them as pure and sacrificial. One should not approach a woman on the new moon or the full moon night; if one were to do so, one would be impotent. The nights of the half-month were the wives of King Soma; of these be did not approach the new moon night and the full moon night [4]. They grasped him about, and illness seized him. &lsquo;Illness has seized the king&rsquo;; that (saying) is the origin of the &lsquo;king&rsquo;s evil &lsquo;. In that he became worse, that is (the origin) of the &lsquo;bad illness&rsquo;; because he got it from his wives, that is (the origin) of the &lsquo;wife&rsquo;s disease&rsquo; (Jayenya), him who knows thus the origin of these illnesses, these illnesses do not visit. He ran up to these two in reverence; they said, &lsquo;Let us choose a boon; let us be the appointers of portions for the gods [5]; from us let the gods be sacrificed to.&rsquo; Therefore of the series of nights it is on the new and the full moon night that the gods are sacrificed to; for they are the appointers of portions for the gods. Men appoint portions to him who knows thus. Creatures slew hunger, man at once, the gods at the half-month, the Pitrs in a month, trees in a year. Therefore day by day men desire food, at the half-month the gods are sacrificed to, every month offering is made to the Pitrs, in a year trees produce fruit. He who knows thus slays the enemy, hunger.<br>
The Part of the Hotr at the New and Full Moon Sacrifices</p>
<h3 id="07-4">07</h3>
<p>The gods could not rest on the Rc or the Yajus. On the Saman only could they rest. He makes the noise &lsquo;Him&rsquo;; verily he makes the Saman. He makes the noise &lsquo;Him&rsquo;; where the gods rested, there he sets them in motion. He makes the noise &lsquo;Him&rsquo;; this is the yoking of speech. He makes the noise &lsquo;Him&rsquo;; thus the sacrificers produce offspring. He repeats the first (verse) thrice, the last thrice; verily he ties the end of the sacrifice [1] so that it may not slip. He repeats (it) continuously, for the continuity of the breaths and of food, and for the smiting away of the Raksases. The first he repeats is connected with the Rathantara (Saman), this world is connected with the Rathantara; verily he conquers this world. He divides it thrice; these worlds are three; verily he conquers these worlds. The last he repeats is connected with the Brhat (Saman); yonder world is connected with the Brhat; verily he conquers yonder world. &lsquo;Forward [2] your viands&rsquo;, he repeats, a verse which has not any indication (of its deity) and (therefore) is addressed to Prajapati. Prajapati is the sacrifice; verily he grasps the sacrifice as Prajapati. &lsquo;Forward your viands&rsquo;, he repeats; viands are food; verily he wins food. &lsquo;Forward your viands&rsquo;, he repeats; therefore seed is deposited in front. &lsquo;O Agni, come hither for the feast&rsquo;, he repeats; therefore offspring are born at the back. &lsquo;Forward your viands&rsquo;, he repeats [3]; &lsquo;viands&rsquo; are the months, &lsquo;heavenwards&rsquo; are the half-months, &lsquo;rich in the oblation&rsquo; are the gods, &lsquo;full of butter&rsquo; is the cow, &lsquo;he goes to the gods&rsquo; (that is) the sacrifice, &lsquo;desirous of favour &rsquo; is the sacrificer. &lsquo;Thou art this, thou art this&rsquo;, (with these words) he wins the dear abode of the sacrifice. If he desire for a man, &lsquo;May he live all his days&rsquo;, he should repeat for him &lsquo;Forward your viands&rsquo;, and then continuously the next half-verse of &lsquo;Agni, come hither to the feast&rsquo; [4]. Verily by expiration does he make steadfast his inspiration, and he lives all his days. He, who knows the elbow of the Samidhenis, puts his enemy in his elbow. He joins the half-verses; this is the elbow of the Samidhenis; he who knows thus puts his foe in his elbow. The Samidhenis were brought out by Rsi after Rsi; if they were not connected together, they would go away from the sacrificer&rsquo;s offspring</p>
<p>and cattle. He unites the half-verses; verily he connects them together, and being so connected and secured they yield him all his desires.</p>
<h3 id="08-4">08</h3>
<p>Without a Saman there is no sacrifice. &lsquo;O Agni, come hither for the feast&rsquo;, he says; this is the character of the Rathantara. &lsquo;Thee with the kindling-sticks, O Angiras&rsquo;, he says; this is the character of the Vamadevya. &lsquo;The great and powerful one, O Agni&rsquo;, he says. This is the character of the Brhat. In that he repeats this Trca, he makes the sacrifice have Samans. Agni was in yonder world, the sun in this; these worlds were disturbed [1]. The gods said, &lsquo;Let us change them about.&rsquo; (Saying), &lsquo;O Agni, come hither for the feast&rsquo;, they placed Agni in this world, and (saying),&lsquo;The great and powerful one, O Agni&rsquo;, they placed the sun in yonder world. Then indeed these worlds became calm. In that he repeats (it) thus, (it serves) for the calming of these worlds; these worlds become calm for him who knows thus. He repeats fifteen Samidhenis [2]. The nights of the half-month are fifteen; the year is made up of half-months. There are three hundred and sixty syllables in the Samidhenis; there are as many nights in the year; verily by syllables he obtains the year. Nrmedha and Paruchepa had a theological dispute (and said), &lsquo;Let us generate fire in the dry wood (to see) which of us two is the more of a theologian.&rsquo; Nrmedha spoke; he generated smoke. Paruchepa spoke; he generated fire. &lsquo;O Rsi&rsquo;, he said, [3], &lsquo;seeing that our knowledge is equal, how didst thou generate fire and not I?&rsquo; &lsquo;I know the character of the Samidhenis&rsquo;, he replied. The character of the Samidhenis is the quarter-verse which is repeated with the word &lsquo;ghee&rsquo; in it. &lsquo;Thee with the kindling sticks, Angiras&rsquo;, he says; verily he generates light in the Samidhenis. They are feminine in that they are Rc (verses), they are feminine in that they are Gayatri (verses), they are feminine in that they are Samidhenis. He repeats a verse with the word &lsquo;Male&rsquo; in it [4]. By it he gives them a husband, makes them possess Indra, and mates them. Agni was the messenger of the gods, Uśanas Kavya of the Asuras. They went to question Prajapati; he turned away (from Uśanas) (with the words). &lsquo;Agni as messenger we choose.&rsquo; Then the gods prospered, the Asuras were defeated. The man for whom, knowing thus, he repeats, &lsquo;Agni as messenger we choose, prospers himself, his enemy is defeated. He repeats a verse with the word &lsquo;imperishable&rsquo;; verily by it he causes his enemy to perish [5]. &lsquo;The flaming locked, him we adore&rsquo;, he says; that is purifying; verily with it he makes pure the sacrificer. &lsquo;Thou art lit, O Agni, worshipped&rsquo;, he says; verily he places around a barrier that may not be climbed. If he were to add anything further, it would be just as when (a libation) falls outside the barriers. There are three Agnis, the oblation bearer of the gods, the bearer of the offering of the Pitrs, the guardian of the Asuras. They repeat, &lsquo;Me will he choose, me&rsquo; [6]. &lsquo;Choose ye the bearer of the oblation&rsquo;, he says; &rsquo;let him choose him who is of the gods. He chooses one of a Rsi&rsquo;s family; verily he departs not from the connexion, (and so it serves) for continuity. He chooses, beginning at the further end, in order of descent; therefore the Pitrs drink after men in order of descent, beginning at the further end.</p>
<h3 id="09-4">09</h3>
<p>&lsquo;O Agni, thou art great&rsquo;, he says, for Agni is great. &lsquo;O Brahman&rsquo;, he says, for he is a Brahman. &lsquo;O Bharata&rsquo;,&rsquo; he says, for he bears the sacrifice to the gods. &lsquo;Kindled by the gods&rsquo;, he says, for the gods kindled him. &lsquo;Kindled by Manu&rsquo;, he says, for Manu kindled him after the gods. &lsquo;Praised by the Rsis&rsquo;, he says, for the Rsis praised him. &lsquo;Rejoiced in by sages&rsquo;, he says [1], for learned people are sages. &lsquo;Celebrated by the poets&rsquo;, he says, for learned people are the poets. &lsquo;Quickened by the holy power (Brahman)&rsquo;, he says, for he is quickened by the holy power (Brahman). &lsquo;With ghee offering&rsquo;, he says, for ghee is his dearest offering. &lsquo;Leader of the sacrifices&rsquo;, he says, for he is the leader of the sacrifices. &lsquo;Charioteer of the rites&rsquo;, he says, for he is the chariot of the gods. &lsquo;The Hotr unsurpassed&rsquo;, he says, for no one surpasses him [2]. &lsquo;Surpassing, bearing the oblation&rsquo;, he says, for he surpasses all. &lsquo;The mouth dish, the ladle of the gods&rsquo;, he says, for he is the ladle of the gods. &lsquo;The bowl from which the gods drink&rsquo;, he says, for he is the bowl from which the gods drink. &lsquo;O Agni, like a felly the spokes, thou dost surround the gods&rsquo;, he says, for he surrounds the gods. If he were to say, &lsquo;Bring hither the gods to the pious sacrificer&rsquo;, he would produce an enemy for him [3].2 &lsquo;Bring hither the gods to the sacrificer&rsquo;, he says; verily with that be makes the sacrificer to grow great. &lsquo;O</p>
<p>Agni, bring Agni hither, bring Soma hither&rsquo;, he says; verily he summons the gods in order. &lsquo;Bring hither the gods, O Agni; and sacrifice to them with a fair sacrifice, O Jatavedas&rsquo;, he says; verily he quickens Agni, and quickened by him he bears the oblation to the gods. &lsquo;Agni the Hotr&rsquo; [4], he says; Agni is the Hotr of the gods; him he chooses who is the Hotr of the gods. &lsquo;We are&rsquo;, he says; verily he makes himself attain reality. &lsquo;Fair be to thee the deity, O sacrificer&rsquo;, he says; verily he invokes this blessing (on him). If he were to say &lsquo;Who hast chosen Agni as Hotr&rsquo;, he would surround the sacrificer with Agni on both sides, and he would be liable to perish. The ladle has the sacrificer for its deity, the Upabhrt the enemy as its deity [5]. If he were to say two as it were, he would produce an enemy for him. &lsquo;Take, Adhvaryu, the spoon (sruc) with ghee&rsquo;, he says; verily by it he causes the sacrificer to wax great. &lsquo;Pious&rsquo;, he says, for he aids the gods, &lsquo;With all boons&rsquo;, he says, for he aids all. &lsquo;Let us praise the gods worthy of praise; let us honour those worthy of honour; let us sacrifice to those worthy of sacrifice&rsquo;, he says. Those worthy of praise are men; those worthy of honour are the Pitrs; those worthy of sacrifice are the gods; verily he sacrifices to the deities according to their portions.</p>
<h3 id="10-3">10</h3>
<p>In the case of a Rajanya let him repeat the Trcas thrice three other sorts of men are there besides the warrior, the Brahman, Vaiśya and Çudra; verily he makes them obedient to him. He should repeat fifteen (Samidhenis) in the case of a Rajanya; the Rajanya is fifteenfold; verily he makes him find support in his own Stoma. Let him surround it with a Tristubh; the Tristubh is power, the Rajanya sacrifices in desire of power; verily by the Tristubh he secures power for him. If he desires [1], &lsquo;May there be splendour&rsquo;, he should surround it with a Gayatri, the Gayatri is splendour; verily there is splendour. He should repeat seventeen for a Vaiśya; the Vaiśya is seventeenfold; verily he makes him find support in his own Stoma. He should surround it with a Jagati; cattle are connected with the Jagati, the Vaiśya sacrifices in desire of cattle; verily by the Jagati he secures cattle for him. He should repeat twenty one for one who desires support; the Ekavinśa is the support of the Stomas; (verily twenty-one serve) for support [2]. He should repeat twenty-four for one who desires splendour: the Gayatri has twenty-four syllables, splendour is the Gayatri; verily by the Gayatri he secures splendour for him. He should repeat thirty for one who desires food; the Viraj has thirty syllables, the Viraj is food; verily by the Viraj he secures food for him. He should repeat thirty-two, for one who desires support; the Anustubh has thirty-two syllables, the Anustubh is the support of the metres; (verily thirty-two serve) for support. He should repeat thirty-six for one who desires cattle; the Brhati has thirty-six syllables, cattle are connected with the Brhati; verily by the Brhati he secures cattle for him [3]. He should repeat forty-four for one who desires power, the Tristubh has forty-four syllables, the Tristubh is power; verily by the Tristubh he secures power for him. He should repeat forty-eight for one who desires cattle; the Jagati has forty-eight syllables, cattle are connected with the Jagati; verily with the Jagati he secures cattle for him. He should repeat all the metres for one who makes many sacrifices, for all the metres are won by him who makes many sacrifices. He should repeat indefinitely to win that which is not definite.</p>
<h3 id="11-4">11</h3>
<p>The thread is worn around the neck for men, over the right shoulder for the Pitrs, over the left for the gods. He puts it over the left shoulder; verily he makes the mark of the gods. He repeats standing, for standing he speaks more audibly. He repeats standing, to conquer the world of heaven. He sacrifices sitting; verily he finds support in this world. In that he repeats in the Krauñca, note, that is connected with the Asuras, in the low note, that is connected with men, in the intermediate note, that is connected with the gods. One should repeat in the intermediate note, to secure the gods. Clever indeed [1] were the Hotrs of old; there fore the ways were held apart, and the paths did not conflict. One foot should be within the sacrificial altar, the other outside; then he repeats, to hold the ways apart and to avoid conflict of the paths. Then does he win the past and the future, the measured and the unmeasured does he win, domestic and wild cattle both does he win [2]; verily also the world of the gods and the world of men he conquers.</p>
<p>The gods having repeated the Samidhenis could not see the sacrifice. Prajapati in silence performed the sprinkling of the butter. Then indeed did the gods see the sacrifice. In that he silently sprinkles, (it serves) to light up the sacrifice. Verily also he anoints the kindling-sticks. He who knows thus becomes soft. Verily also he delights them. He delights in offspring and cattle [3] who knows thus. If he were to sprinkle with one (verse), he would delight one; if with two, (he would delight) two; if with three, he would make (the offering) go beyond (all others). He sprinkles (repeating the verse) in the mind, for what is imperfect is made perfect by mind. He sprinkles across so as not to make a failure. Speech and mind disputed; &lsquo;I will bear the offering to the gods&rsquo;, speech said; &lsquo;I to the gods&rsquo;, mind said. They went to question Prajapati; he said [4], Prajapati, &lsquo;Thou art the messenger of mind, for what one thinks of in the mind, one utters in speech&rsquo;. &lsquo;Then assuredly they will not sacrifice to you with speech&rsquo;, said (speech). Therefore in the mind they offer to Prajapati, for Prajapati is, as it were, the mind; (verily it serves) to obtain Prajapati. He rubs the enclosing-sticks; verily he purifies them. (He rubs) the middle one thrice; the breaths are three; verily he conquers the breaths. (He rubs) the southern one thrice; these worlds are three [5]; verily he conquers these worlds. (He rubs) the northern one thrice; three are the paths leading to the gods; verily he conquers them. Thrice he fans (the fire); the worlds of the gods are three; verily he conquers the worlds of the gods. They make twelve; the year has twelve months; verily he delights the year; verily also he brings up the year for him, to gain the world of heaven. He sprinkles; the world of heaven is as it were secret [6]; verily he makes the world of heaven resplendent for him. He sprinkles straight, for the breath is as it were straight. He sprinkles continuously, for the continuity of the breaths and of food and for the smiting away of the Raksases. If he desire of a man, &lsquo;May he be likely to perish&rsquo;, he should sprinkle crookedly for him; verily he leads his breath crookedly from him, and swiftly he perishes. The sprinkling is the head of the sacrifice, the ladle is the body [7]. Having sprinkled, he anoints the ladle; verily he places the head of the sacrifice on its body. Agni was the messenger of the gods, Daivya of the Asuras; they went to question Prajapati. Prajapati spake to a Brahman (saying), &lsquo;Explain the phrase, &ldquo;Make announcement&rdquo;&rsquo;, &lsquo;Hearken to this, O ye gods&rsquo;, he said; &lsquo;Agni the god is the Hotr&rsquo;, (he said). He chose him of the gods. Then the gods [8] prospered, the Asuras were defeated. The man, who knows thus and for whom they chose his list of ancestors, prospers himself, his enemy is defeated. If a Brahman and a non-Brahman have a litigation, one should support the Brahman; if one supports the Brahman, one supports oneself; if one opposes the Brahman, one opposes oneself therefore one should not oppose a Brahman.</p>

<p>He offers to the kindling-sticks; verily he wins spring among the seasons. He offers to Tanunapat; verily he wins the hot season. He offers to the oblations; verily he wins the rains. He offers to the sacrificial strew, verily lie wins autumn. He offers with the cry of &lsquo;Hail!&rsquo;; verily he wins the winter. Therefore in winter animals over which the cry of &lsquo;Hail!&rsquo; is raised perish. He offers to the kindling sticks; verily he wins the dawns of the goddesses. He offers to Tanunapat; verily he wins the sacrifice [1]. He offers to the oblations; verily he wins cattle. He offers to the sacrificial strew; verily he wins offspring. He takes (the oblation) from the Upabhrt. The oblation is brilliance, the sacrificial strew off spring; verily he places brilliance in offspring. He offers with the cry of &lsquo;Hail!&rsquo;; verily he wins speech. They make up ten, the Viraj has ten syllables, the Viraj is food; verily he wins food by the Viraj. He offers to the kindling-sticks; verily he finds support in this world. He offers to Tanunapat [2]; verily in the sacrifice and in the atmosphere he finds support. He offers to the oblations; verily in cattle he finds support. He offers to the sacrificial strew; verily he finds support in the paths that lead to the gods. He offers with the cry of &lsquo;Hail!&rsquo;; verily he finds support in the world of heaven. So many are the worlds of the gods; verily in them in order he finds support. The gods and the Asuras contended as to these worlds. The gods by the fore-sacrifices drove the Asuras away from these worlds; that is why the fore-sacrifices [3] are so called. He for whom knowing thus are offered the fore-sacrifices, drives his enemy away from these worlds. He offers stepping near, for conquest. He who knows the pairing of the fore sacrifices is propagated with offspring, with cattle, with pairings. He offers to the kindling-sticks as many, to Tanunapat as one, and that makes a pair. He offers to the kindling-sticks as many, to the sacrificial strew as one, and that makes a pair. That is the pairing of the fore-sacrifices. He who knows thus [4] is propagated with offspring, with cattle, with pairings. These deities were not sacrificed to by the gods; then the Asuras were fain to harm the sacrifice. The gods divided the Gayatri, five syllables in front and three behind. Then the sacrifice was protected, and the sacrificer. In that the fore- and after sacrifices are offered, protection is afforded to the sacrifice and to the sacrificer, for the overcoming of the enemy. Therefore a covering is larger in front and smaller behind. The gods thought that the sacrifice must be completed (in the fore-sacrifice) before the Raksases [5] with the cry of &lsquo;Hail!&rsquo; They completed it with the cry of &lsquo;Hail!&rsquo; in the fore-sacrifices. They split the sacrifice who complete it with the cry of &lsquo;Hail!&rsquo; in the fore-sacrifices. Having offered the fore sacrifices he sprinkles the oblations, for the continuity of the sacrifice; then verily he makes the oblation, and then he proceeds in order. The fore-sacrifices are the father, the after-sacrifices the son; in that having offered the fore-sacrifices he sprinkles the oblations, the father makes common property with the son [6]. Therefore they say, who know it or who know not, &lsquo;How is it the son&rsquo;s only, how is the father&rsquo;s common?&rsquo; That which spills when the fore-sacrifices are offered is not really spilt. The Gayatri conceives through it, and produces offspring and cattle for the sacrificer.</p>
<h3 id="02-5">02</h3>
<p>The two portions of the oblation are the eyes of the sacrifice. In that he offers the two portions of the oblation, he inserts the two eyes of the sacrifice. He offers in the front place; therefore the eyes are in front. He offers evenly; therefore the eyes are even. By Agni the sacrificer discerns the world of the gods, by Soma the world of the Pitrs; in the north part he offers to Agni, in the south to Soma, for these worlds are thus, as it were, to illumine these worlds. Agni and Soma are the kings of the gods [1]. They are sacrificed to between the gods, to separate the gods. Therefore men are separated by the king. The theologians say, &lsquo;What is it that the sacrificer does in the sacrifice to support both those animals which have incisors on one side only and those which have incisors on both?&rsquo; When he has repeated a Rc, he makes an offering of the portion of the oblation with the jusana formula; by that means he supports those with incisors on one side only. When he has repeated a Rc, he makes an offering of the sacrificial food (havis) with a Rc; by that means he supports those with incisors on both sides. The Puronuvakya contains the word &lsquo;head&rsquo;; verily he makes him head of his peers [2]. He offers with averse containing the word &rsquo;team&rsquo; (niyut); verily he appropriates (ni-yu) the cattle of his enemy. Keśin Satyakami said to Keśin Darbhya, &lsquo;The seven-footed Çakvari I shall use for thee at the sacrifice to-morrow, by whose strength one defeats the enemies that have arisen and those that shall be, by the first half of whose strength the ox feeds, by the second half the cow.&rsquo; The Puronuvakya is marked in front; verily he defeats the enemies that have arisen; the Yajya is marked</p>
<p>behind [3]; verily he defeats the enemies that shall be. The Puronuvakya is marked in front; verily he places light in this world; the Yajya is marked behind; verily he places light in yonder world. Full of light become these worlds to him who knows thus. The Puronuvakya, is marked in front; therefore the ox feeds with the first half. The Yajya is marked behind; therefore the cow feeds with the second half. Him who knows thus these two enjoy. The oblation is a bolt, the portions of the oblation are a bolt [4], the Vasat call is a bolt; thus forges be a threefold bolt and hurls it at his foe, so as not to make a failure. He utters the Vasat call in anger, to lay low his foe. The Puronuvakya is the Gayatri, the Yajya the Tristubh; verily he makes the ruling class dependent on the priestly class; therefore the Brahman is the chief. The chief he becomes who knows thus. He proclaims him with the Puronuvakya, leads him forward with the Yajya, and makes him go with the Vasat call. He takes him with the Puronuvakya, he gives him with the Yajya, and [5] establishes him with the Vasat call. The Puronuvakya has three feet; these worlds are three; verily he finds support in these worlds. The Yajya has four feet; verily he wins four footed cattle. The Vasat call has two syllables, the sacrificer has two feet; verily afterwards he finds support in cattle. The Puronuvakya is the Gayatri, the Yajya, the Tristubh, and this is the sevenfooted Çakvari. Whatever the gods were fain to do by it, that they were able to do; he who knows thus can do whatever he is fain to do.</p>
<h3 id="03-5">03</h3>
<p>Prajapati assigned the sacrifices to the gods. He placed in himself the oblation. The gods said to him, &lsquo;The oblation is the sacrifice; let us have a share in it.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;Lot them offer to you the portions of the oblation, let them pour out (a layer), let them sprinkle (it).&rsquo; Therefore they offer the portions of the oblation, they pour out (a layer), and sprinkle (it). The theologians say, &lsquo;For what reason are the other offerings worn out, but the oblation fresh?&rsquo; He should reply, &lsquo;Because it is Prajapati&rsquo;s [1], for Prajapati is of the gods the fresh one.&rsquo; The metres ran away from the gods (saying), &lsquo;We will not bear the offering, if we have no share.&rsquo; They kept for them (the offering) divided into four parts, for the Puronuvakya, the Yajya, the deity, the Vasat call. In that he offers (the offering) in four parts, he delights the metres, and they delighted by him carry the offering to the gods. The Angirases were the last to go hence to the world of heaven. The Rsis came to the place of sacrifice; they [2] saw the sacrificial cake creeping about, having become a tortoise. They said to it, &lsquo;Be firm for Indra; be firm for Brhaspati: be firm for the All-gods.&rsquo; It did not become firm. They said to it, &lsquo;Be firm for Agni.&rsquo; It became firm for Agni. In that (the cake) for Agni on eight potsherds is unmoved at the full and at the new moon, (it serves) to conquer the world of heaven. They said to it, &lsquo;How hast thou been left?&rsquo; &lsquo;I have not been anointed&rsquo;, he said, &lsquo;just as an axle not anointed [3] goes wrong, so I have gone wrong.&rsquo; After anointing it above, he anoints it below, to gain the world of heaven. He spreads (the cake) on all the fragments; so many cakes does he conquer in yonder world. That which is burnt belongs to Nirrti, that which is not cooked to Rudra, that which is cooked to the gods. Therefore one should cook it, without burning it, for the gods. He covers it with ashes; therefore the bones are clothed with flesh. He covers it with the bunch of grass; therefore [4] the head is covered with hair. The offering which is cooked without being sprinkled has fallen from this world, but has not reached the world of the gods. He sprinkles it before covering it; verily he makes it go among the gods. If one fragment were lost, one month of the year would be omitted, and the sacrificer would perish. If two were lost, two months of the year would be omitted, and the sacrificer would perish. He counts before covering, to guard the sacrificer [5]. If it be lost, be should make an offering on two potsherds to the Aśvins, and on one potsherd to sky and earth. The Aśvins are the physicians of the gods; verily by them he heals it. Then is offered an offering on one potsherd to sky and earth; in them is lost what is lost; verily in them he finds it, (and it serves) for support.</p>
<h3 id="04-5">04</h3>
<p>(Saying) &lsquo;On the impulse of the god Savitr thee&rsquo;, he takes the sword, for impelling. &lsquo;With the arms of the Aśvins&rsquo;, he says, for the Aśvins were the Adhvaryus of the gods. &lsquo;With the hands of Pusan&rsquo;, he says, for restraint. &lsquo;Thou art a hundred-edged, of the tree, slayer of the foe&rsquo;, he says; verily he sharpens the bolt, being about to hurl it at his enemy. He throws away the grass with a Yajus. The</p>
<p>earth is the size of the altar; verily he deprives his enemy of so much of that [1]. Therefore they do not deprive one who has no share. He throws it away thrice; these worlds are three; verily he excludes him from these worlds. He throws it silently a fourth time; verily he excludes him from the unmeasured. He uproots it; verily what of it is impure he cuts off. He uproots it; therefore the plants perish. He cuts the root; verily he cuts the root of the enemy. If dug too deep, it has the Pitrs for its deity; so much does he dig as is measured [2] by Prajapati as the mouth of the sacrifice. He digs until (he reaches) support; verily he causes the sacrificer to reach support. He makes it higher on the south; verily he makes it the form of the sacrificial ground. He makes it full of loose earth; loose earth is offspring and cattle; verily he makes him full of offspring and cattle. He performs the second drawing of a boundary. The earth is the size of the altar; verily having excluded his enemy from so much of it, he performs the second drawing of a boundary for himself. Cruelly he acts [3] in making an altar. (With the words) &lsquo;Thou art the holder, thou art the self holder&rsquo;, it is made smooth, for healing. He places the sprinkling waters; the waters are Raksas-slaying; (verily they serve) for slaying the Raksases. He places them in the path made by the sword, for the continuity of the sacrifice. He should think of any one whom he hates; verily does he inflict trouble upon him.</p>
<h3 id="05-5">05</h3>
<p>The theologians say, &lsquo;Thou hast sprinkled the offerings with water; but the waters with what?&rsquo; &lsquo;With the holy power (Brahman)&rsquo;, he should say, for verily he sprinkles the offerings with water, and the waters with the holy power (Brahman). He sprinkles the kindling-wood and the sacrificial strew; verily he makes it pure. He sprinkles the altar, the altar was rough, hairless, and impure; verily he makes it pure. &lsquo;To the sky thee, to the atmosphere thee, to earth thee&rsquo;, (with these words) he places the sacrificial strew and sprinkles it [1]; verily he sprinkles it for these worlds. Cruelly indeed does he act in that he digs. He pours down the waters, for healing. He takes the bunch in front; verily he makes it the chief. He takes so much as is measured by Prajapati as the mouth of the sacrifice. He spreads the sacrificial strew, the sacrificial strew is offspring, the altar is the earth; verily he places offspring on the earth. He strews it so as not to be very discernible; verily he makes him not very discernible by offspring and cattle [2]. He puts the bundle over the sacrificial strew, the strew is offspring, the bundle the sacrificer; verily he makes the sacrificer superior to the non-sacrificer. Therefore the sacrificer is superior to the non-sacrificer. He puts (grass) between, for separation. He anoints it; verily he makes it into an offering and causes it to go to the world of heaven. He anoints it in three places; these worlds are three; verily he anoints it for these worlds. He does not break off (its edges); if he were to break them off, it would not go aloft for the sacrificer. He pushes it upwards as it were [3], for the world of heaven is upwards as it were. He depresses it; verily he brings down rain for him. He should not put forward the points too much; if he were to do so, there would be a violent torrent to destroy the Adhvaryu. He should not throw it (so that the roots are) in front. If he were to do this, he would thrust the sacrificer from the world of heaven. He puts it forward (with its points) to the east; verily he makes the sacrificer go to the world of heaven. He should not spread (the bunch) in all directions. If he were to spread (it) in all directions [4], a daughter would be born to him. He strews it upwards, for upwards is as it were connected with a man; verily a male child is born to him. If he were to smooth it with the sword or the poking-stick, that would be his ruin. He smooths it with his hand, for the protection of the sacrificer. The theologians say, &lsquo;What in the sacrifice is the sacrificer&rsquo; &lsquo;The bundle&rsquo; (is the reply). &lsquo;Where in it is the world of heaven?&rsquo; &lsquo;The Ahavaniya (fire)&rsquo; he should reply. In that he puts the bundle on the Ahavaniya, he makes the sacrificer [5] go to the world of heaven. The sacrificer is rent in that they smooth the bundle; he throws the strew along after it, for calming. The Adhvaryu has no support, and he is liable to be seized by shivering. (With the words), &lsquo;Thou art firm (dhruva)&rsquo;, he strokes it; the Dhruva is this (earth); verily he finds support in it, and shivers not. &lsquo;Has he gone, O Agnidh? he says. If (the Agnidh) were to say, &lsquo;Agni has gone?&rsquo; he would make Agni go into the fire, and exclude the sacrificer from the world of heaven. So he should say only &lsquo;Has he gone?&rsquo; Verily he makes the sacrificer go to the world of heaven.</p>
<h3 id="06-5">06</h3>
<p>Agni had three elder brothers; they perished while carrying the offering to the gods. Agni was afraid, &lsquo;Thus indeed will this one fall on misfortune.&rsquo; He ran away, and entered the waters. The gods sought to start him up. The fish proclaimed him, and he cursed it, &lsquo;At Pleasure may they slay thee, since thou hast proclaimed me.&rsquo; So they slay the fish at pleasure, for he is cursed [1]. They found him; they said, &lsquo;Come to us, and carry the offering for us.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;Let me choose a boon; whatever of the offering when it is taken (in the ladle) falls outside the enclosing-sticks, let that be the share of my brothers.&rsquo; There fore whatever of the offering when it is taken falls outside the enclosing sticks is their share; verily by it he delights them. He puts the enclosing sticks around, to smite away the Raksases. He makes them touch [2], so that the Raksases may not creep through. He puts none in front, for the sun rises in front and smites away the Raksases. He places the two kindling sticks upright, for upwards they smite away the Raksases. (He places) one with a Yajus, the other in silence, to make a pair. He places two, the sacrificer has two feet, for support. The theologians say, &lsquo;He indeed would be a sacrificer who should be the stronger for a failure in the sacrifice.&rsquo; (The words), &lsquo;To the lord of earth hail! To the lord of the world, hail! To the lord of creatures [3] hail! &rsquo; he should pronounce over the spilt (offering). Thus by a failure in the sacrifice he becomes stronger, for he delights more gods (than usual). There is sameness in the sacrifice, in that there are two sacrificial cakes (offered) in order. Between them he offers the silent sacrifice, to break the sameness and to make a pair. Agni was in yonder world, Yama in this. The gods said, &lsquo;Come, let us interchange them&rsquo;; with food the gods invited Agni [4], with the kingdom the Pitrs Yama; therefore is Agni the food-eater of the gods, Yama the king of the Pitrs; he who knows thus obtains the kingdom and food. To him they gave that share which they cut off for Agni Svistakrt. In that he cuts off a share for Agni Svistakrt, he gives Rudra a share. He cuts off one in each case, for Rudra is one as it were. He cuts off from the north part, for this is Rudra&rsquo;s [5] quarter; verily he appeases Rudra in his own quarter. He sprinkles it twice, to make it divided into four. The former offerings are cattle, Agni is Rudra here; if he were to pour over the former offerings, he would give Rudra cattle, and the sacrificer would be without cattle. He offers leaving the former oblations aside, to protect the cattle.<br>
The Part of the Hotr in the New and Full Moon Sacrifice</p>
<h3 id="07-5">07</h3>
<p>Manu desired what of earth was sacrificial. He found the poured out ghee. He said, &lsquo;Who is able to produce this also at the sacrifice?&rsquo; Mitra and Varuna said, &lsquo;We are able to produce the cow.&rsquo; Then they set the cow in motion. Wherever she stepped, there ghee was pressed out; therefore she is called ghee-footed; that is her origin. &lsquo;The Rathantara is invoked with the earth&rsquo;, he says [1]. The Rathantara is this (earth); verily he invokes her with food. &lsquo;The Vamadevya is invoked with the atmosphere&rsquo;, he says. The Vamadevya, is cattle; verily he invokes cattle with the atmosphere. &lsquo;The Brhat is invoked with the sky&rsquo;, he says. The Brhat is connected with food; verily he invokes food with the sky. &rsquo; The seven Hotras are invoked&rsquo;, he says; verily he invokes the Hotras. &lsquo;The cow is invoked with the bull&rsquo;, he says [2]; verily he invokes a pair. &lsquo;The friend food is invoked&rsquo;, he says; verily he invokes the Soma drink. &lsquo;It is invoked; ho!&rsquo; he says; verily he invokes the self, for the self is the best of those invoked. He invokes food, food is cattle; verily he invokes cattle. He invokes four, for cattle are four-footed. &lsquo;Offspring of Manu&rsquo;, he says, for Manu first saw her [3]. &lsquo;Ghee footed&rsquo;, he says. Because ghee was pressed out of her foot, therefore be says thus. &lsquo;Of Mitra and Varuna&rsquo;, he says, for Mitra and Varuna set her in motion. &lsquo;The Brahman, god made, is invoked&rsquo;, he says; verily he invokes the Brahman. &lsquo;The divine Adhvaryus are invoked, the human are invoked&rsquo;, he says; verily he invokes the gods and men. &lsquo;Who shall help this sacrifice and make the lord of the sacrifice prosper&rsquo;, he says [4]; verily he invokes a blessing for the sacrifice and the sacrificer. &lsquo;Sky and earth are invoked&rsquo;, he says; verily he invokes sky and earth. &lsquo;Born of yore, the righteous&rsquo;, he says, for they were born of yore and are righteous. &lsquo;Divine, with gods for children&rsquo;, he says, for they are divine and have gods for children. &lsquo;Invoked is this sacrificer&rsquo;, he says; verily he invokes the sacrificer. &lsquo;Invoked in the highest sacrifice, invoked in the greater offering, invoked in the divine abode&rsquo; [5], he says. The highest sacrifice is offspring, the greater offering is cattle, the divine abode</p>
<p>is the world of heaven. (With the words), &lsquo;Thou art this; thou art this&rsquo;, he invokes the dear abode of the sacrifice. &lsquo;All that is dear to it is invoked&rsquo;, he says; verily not vainly does he invoke.</p>
<h3 id="08-5">08</h3>
<p>Food is cattle, he takes it himself; verily by himself he fills his desires of cattle, for no one else can grant him his desire of cattle. &lsquo;Thee offered to the lord of speech I eat&rsquo;, he says; verily he delights speech with a share. &lsquo;Thee offered to the lord of the Sadas I eat&rsquo;, he says, for completion.&rsquo; (The food) is divided. in four; what is divided in four is the offering, what is divided in four is cattle; if the Hotr were to eat it, the Hotr would [1] experience misfortune; if he were to offer it in the fire, he would give the cattle to Rudra, and the sacrificer would be without cattle. &lsquo;Thee offered to the lord of speech I eat&rsquo;, he says; verily secretly does he offer it. &lsquo;Thee offered to the lord of the Sadas&rsquo;, he says, for completion. They eat; they eat at a suitable moment; he gives a sacrificial gift; at a suitable moment be gives a gift. They cleave the sacrifice [2], if they eat in the middle. They purify it with water; all the gods are the waters; verily they connect the sacrifice with the gods. The gods excluded Rudra from the sacrifice; he pierced the sacrifice, the gods gathered round it (saying), &lsquo;May it be right for us.&rsquo; They said, &lsquo;Well offered will this be for us, if we propitiate him.&rsquo; That is why Agni is called the &lsquo;well offerer&rsquo; (svistakrt). When it was pierced (by him) [3] they cut off (a piece) of the size of a barleycorn; therefore one should cut off (a piece) the size of a barleycorn. If one were to cut off more, he would confuse that part of the sacrifice. If he were to make a layer and then to sprinkle, lie would make it swell on both sides. He cuts it off and sprinkles it; there are two operations; the sacrificer has two feet, for support. If he were to transfer it (to the Brahman) crosswise, he would pierce the unwounded part of the sacrifice; lie transfers it in front; verily he transfers it in the proper way. They transferred it for Pusan [4]. Pusan having eaten it lost his teeth; therefore Pusan has pounded food for his share, for he has no teeth. The gods said of him, &lsquo;He has lost (his teeth), he is not fit for the offering.&rsquo; They transferred it to Brhaspati. Brhaspati was afraid, &lsquo;Thus indeed will this one fall on misfortune.&rsquo; He saw this Mantra; &lsquo;With the eye of the sun I gaze on thee&rsquo;, he said, for the eye of the sun harms no one [5]. He was afraid, &lsquo;It will harm me as I take it.&rsquo; &lsquo;On the impulse of the god Savitr, with the arms of the Aśvins, with the hands of Pusan I take thee&rsquo;, he says; verily, impelled by Savitr, he took it with the holy power (Brahman) and with the gods. He was afraid, &lsquo;It will harm me as I eat.&rsquo; &lsquo;Thee with the mouth of Agni I eat&rsquo;, he said, for nothing harms the mouth of Agni. He was afraid [6], &lsquo;It will harm me when I have eaten.&rsquo; &lsquo;With the belly of the Brahman&rsquo;, he said, for nothing harms the belly of the Brahman. &lsquo;With the holy power (Brahman) of Brhaspati&rsquo;, (he said), for he is fullest of the holy power (Brahman). The breaths indeed depart from him who eats this offering; by purifying it with water he grasps the breaths; the breaths are ambrosia, the waters ambrosia; verily he summons the breaths according to their places.</p>
<h3 id="09-5">09</h3>
<p>He takes a portion for the Agnidh; verily he delights the seasons whose mouth is Agni. He takes a kindling-stick, for the support of the subsequent offerings; verily he pours on that which has a kindling stick. He rubs the enclosing-sticks; verily he purifies them. He rubs each once, for the sacrifice there is as it were turned away. It makes up four, cattle are four-footed; verily he wins cattle. &lsquo;O Brahman, will we set out?&rsquo; he says; there indeed is the sacrifice placed [1], where the Brahman is; where the sacrifice is placed, thence does he commence it. If he were to instigate him with his hand, he would shiver; if with his head, he would have a headache; if he were to sit in silence, the sacrifice would not proceed; he should say, &lsquo;Set out! In speech the sacrifice is placed; where the sacrifice is placed, thence does he bestow it. &lsquo;O god Savitr, that he [2] hath proclaimed to thee&rsquo;, he says, for impelling. &lsquo;Brhaspati is the (priest) Brahman&rsquo;, he says, for he is fullest of the holy power (Brahman). &lsquo;Do thou guard the sacrifice, guard the lord of the sacrifice, guard me&rsquo;, he says; for the sacrifice, the sacrificer, and himself, for these he thus invokes a blessing, to prevent misfortune, Having caused (him) to call out, he says, &lsquo;Utter the verse for sacrifice to the gods.&rsquo; The theologians say, &lsquo;The gods have been sacrificed to; what gods are they?&rsquo; &lsquo;The metres&rsquo;, he should reply, &lsquo;Gayatri Tristubh [3], and Jagati.&rsquo; Then they say, &lsquo;The metres are the Brahmans&rsquo;; verily he sacrifices to them. The deities were sacrificed to by the gods; then Agni did not burn forth; the gods</p>
<h3 id="10-4">10</h3>
<p>The gods could not find any one to utter the call Svaga at the sacrifice. They spoke to Çamyu Barhaspatya, &lsquo;Perform the Svaga call at this sacrifice for us.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;Let me choose a boon; if a faithless man sacrifice, or a man sacrifices without prescription, let the blessing of such a sacrificer be mine.&rsquo; Therefore if a faithless man sacrifices, or a man sacrifices without prescription, the blessing of such a sacrifice goes to Çamyu Barhaspatya. &lsquo;That is mine&rsquo;, he said, &lsquo;What is to belong to my offspring? [1].&rsquo; &lsquo;Him, who reviles him, he shall fine with a hundred; him, who strikes him, he shall fine with a thousand; he, who draws blood from him, shall not behold the world of the Pitrs for as many years as are the grains of dust which the blood in its fall seizes upon&rsquo;, (they replied). Therefore one should not revile a Brahman, nor strike him, nor draw blood from him; for so great is his sin. &lsquo;That health and wealth we choose&rsquo;, he says; verily he utters the call Svaga, over the sacrifice. &lsquo;That [2] health and wealth we choose&rsquo;, he says; verily he gives Çamyu Barhaspatya his portion. &lsquo;Success to the sacrifice, success to the sacrificer&rsquo;, he says; verily he invokes this blessing. He sacrifices to Soma; verily he places seed; he sacrifices to Tvastr; seed is placed and Tvastr moulds forms; he sacrifices to the wives of the gods, to make a pair; he sacrifices to Agni, lord of the house, for support. There is sameness in the sacrifice [3] in that the fore-sacrifices are offered with butter, and the sacrifices to the wives (are offered) with butter. Having repeated the Rc, of the sacrifices to the wives he offers with a Rc, to prevent sameness, and to make a pairing. The sacrifice has a fivefold prelude and a fivefold end; there are offered five fore-sacrifices; there are four sacrifices to the wives, the fifth is the Samistayajus by they make up five as a prelude, and five as an end.</p>
