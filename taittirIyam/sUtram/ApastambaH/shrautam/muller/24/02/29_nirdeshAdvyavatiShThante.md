In the case of one who sacrifices with Soma, the second principal act is the Sāṃnāyya (both at the full-moon and new-moon sacrifices).

## Commentary

The Sāṃnāyya is a mixture of dadhi and payas, sour and sweet milk, and is intended for Indra or Mahendra[^1]. It takes the place of the second Puroḍāśa at the new-moon sacrifice.
