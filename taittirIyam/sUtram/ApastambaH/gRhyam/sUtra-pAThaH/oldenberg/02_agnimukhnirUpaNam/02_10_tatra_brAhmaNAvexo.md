10. [^6]  There the ritual based on the Brāhmaṇa (holds good),


[^6]:  According to Haradatta, this Sūtra would imply that wheresoever the ritual described in the preceding Sūtras holds good, p. 255 another ritual based on the Brāhmaṇa, and more especially on the treatment of the Agnihotra in the Brāhmaṇa, may be used in its stead.
