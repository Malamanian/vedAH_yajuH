5. [^4]  At the wedding one cow;


[^4]:  5-8. Comp. Śāṅkhāyana-Gṛhya I, 12, 10. It is clear that with the first cow the bride's father has to receive the bridegroom. The 'house' mentioned in Sūtra 6 seems to be the house of the newly-married couple. In the expression 'whom he reveres,' 'he,' according to the commentaries, is the bridegroom.
