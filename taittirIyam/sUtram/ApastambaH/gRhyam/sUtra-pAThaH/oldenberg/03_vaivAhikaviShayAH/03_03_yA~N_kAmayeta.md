3. [^2]  A daughter whom he wishes to be dear (to her husband), a father should give in marriage under the Niṣṭyā (Nakṣatra); thus she becomes dear (to her husband); she does not return (to her father's) house: this is an observance based on a Brāhmaṇa.


[^2]:  Comp. Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa I, 5, 2, 3.
