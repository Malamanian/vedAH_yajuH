11. He (himself) shall erect a hut in the forest, restrain his speech, carry (on his stick) the skull (of the person slain) like a flag, and cover the space from his navel to his knees with a quarter of a piece of hempen cloth. [^6] 


[^6]:  Others say that he may carry the skull of any corpse. This Sūtra is to be construed with Sūtra 14, Sūtras 12 and 13 being inserted parenthetically.--Haradatta. Manu XI, 72-78; Yājñ. III, 243.
