25. He cannot be purified in this life. But his sin is removed (after death). [^12] 


[^12]:  'His sin is removed after death. Hence the meaning is that his sons or other (relations) may perform the funeral ceremonies and the like. But others think that the first part of the Sūtra forbids this, and that the meaning of pratvāpattiḥ (can be p. 82 purified) is "connection by being received as a son or other relation."--Haradatta.
