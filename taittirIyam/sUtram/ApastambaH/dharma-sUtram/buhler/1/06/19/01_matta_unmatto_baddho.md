1. A drunkard, a madman, a prisoner, he who learns the Veda from his son, a creditor who sits with his debtor (hindering the fulfilment of his duties), a debtor who thus sits (with his creditor, are persons whose food must not be eaten) as long as they are thus engaged or in that state. [^1] 


[^1]:  19. Manu IV, 207; Yājñ. I, 161, 162. Another commentator explains aṇika, translated above 'he who learns the Veda from his son,' by 'a money-lender,' and combines pratyupaviṣṭaḥ with this word, i.e. 'a money-lender who sits with his debtor hindering him from fulfilling his duties.' This manner of forcing a debtor to pay, which is also called Ācarita (see Manu VIII, 49), is, though illegal, resorted to sometimes even now.
