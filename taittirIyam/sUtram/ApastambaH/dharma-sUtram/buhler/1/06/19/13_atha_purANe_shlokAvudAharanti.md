13. Now they quote also in a Purāṇa the following two verses: [^5] 


[^5]:  See Manu IV, 248 and 249, where these identical verses occur.

'The Lord of creatures has declared, that food offered unasked and brought by the giver himself, may be eaten, though (the giver be) a sinner, provided the gift has not been announced beforehand. The Manes of the ancestors of that man who spurns such food, do not eat (his oblations) for fifteen years, nor does the fire carry his offerings (to the gods).'
