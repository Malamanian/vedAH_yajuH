8. He shall not be too eager after (such a way of living). He shall leave it when he has obtained a (lawful) livelihood. [^3] 


[^3]:  Haradatta quotes, in support of the last Sūtras, a passage of the Chāndogya Upaniṣad, I, 10, 1, and one from the .Ṛj-veda, IV, 18, 13, according to which it would be lawful to eat even impure food, as a dog's entrails, under such circumstances. Other commentators explain this and the preceding three Sūtras differently. According to them the translation would run thus: 'If he himself does not find any livelihood (in times of distress, he may dwell even with low-caste people who give him something to eat, and) he may eat (food given by them) paying for it with (some small gift in) gold or with animals.' This second explanation is perhaps preferable.
