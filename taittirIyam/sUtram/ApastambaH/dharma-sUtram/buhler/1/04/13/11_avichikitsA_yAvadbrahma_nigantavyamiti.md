11. Hārita declares, that the (whole) Veda must be studied under a vow of obedience until there is no doubt (regarding it in the mind of the pupil). [^7] 


[^7]:  The meaning of Hārita is, that the vow of obedience is required for the Triḥsrāvaṇa and Tr.ihsahavacana, which Āpastamba exempted in the preceding Sūtra. It follows from this rule that the Aṅgas or works explanatory of the Veda need not be studied under a vow of obedience.
