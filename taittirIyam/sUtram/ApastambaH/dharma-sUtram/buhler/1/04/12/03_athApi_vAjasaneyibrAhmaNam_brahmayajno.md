3. Now the Vājasaneyi-brāhmaṇa declares also, 'The daily recitation is a sacrifice at which the Veda is offered. When it thunders, when lightning flashes or thunderbolts fall, and when the wind blows violently, these sounds take the place of the exclamations Vaṣaṭ (Vauṣaṭ and Svāhā). Therefore he shall recite the Veda whilst it thunders, whilst lightning flashes and thunderbolts fall, and whilst the wind blows violently, lest the Vaṣaṭ (should be heard) in vain. [^3] 


[^3]:  See Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa XI, 5, 6, 8, where a passage very similar to that quoted by Āpastamba occurs. Vaṣaṭ and the other exclamations, which are pronounced by the Hotṛ-priest, serve as signals for the Adhvaryu to throw the oblations into the fire.
