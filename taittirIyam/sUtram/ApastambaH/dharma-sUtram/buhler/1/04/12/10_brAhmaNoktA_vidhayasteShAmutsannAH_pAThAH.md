10. (But if you ask, why the decision of the Āryas presupposes the existence of a Vedic passage, then I answer): All precepts were (originally) taught in the Brāhmaṇas, (but) these texts have been lost. Their (former existence) may, however, be inferred from usage. [^7] 


[^7]:  How then is their existence known? 'They are inferred from usage.' '"Usage" means the teaching of the law-books and the practice. From that it is inferred that Manu and other (authors of law-books) knew such texts of the Brāhmaṇas. For how could otherwise (Ṛṣis like Manu) teach in their works or practise (such customs) for which no authority is now found? And certainly they were intimately connected with the revealed texts (i.e. saw them).'-- Haradatta.
