5. 'Now, if the wind blows, or if it thunders, or if lightning flashes, or thunderbolts fall, then he shall recite one Ṛk-verse (in case he studies the Rig-Veda), or one Yajus (in case he studies the Yajur-veda), or one Sāman (in case he studies the Sāma-veda), or (without having a regard to his particular Veda, the following Yajus), "Bhūḥ Bhuvaḥ, Suvaḥ, in faith I offer true devotion." Then, indeed, his daily recitation is accomplished thereby for that day.' [^4] 


[^4]:  'Some suppose that the words Bhūḥ Bhuvaḥ and Suvaḥ &c. (are to be used only) if one studies the Brāhmaṇa portion of the Veda, not every where.'-- Haradatta.
