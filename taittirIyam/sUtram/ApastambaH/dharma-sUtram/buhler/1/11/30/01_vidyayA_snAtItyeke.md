1. Some declare, that a student shall bathe after (having acquired) the knowledge of the Veda, (however long or short the time of his studentship may have been). [^1] 


[^1]:  30. The bath is taken at the end of the studentship, and forms part of the Samāvartana-ceremony. From this rite a student who has completed his course of study derives the name Snātaka, 'one who has bathed.' See also Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 125.
