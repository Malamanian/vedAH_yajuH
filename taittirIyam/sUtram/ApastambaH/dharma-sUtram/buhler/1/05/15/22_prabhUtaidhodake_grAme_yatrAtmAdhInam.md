22. It is lawful for a Brāhmaṇa to dwell in a village, where there is plenty of fuel and water, (and) where he may perform the rites of purification by himself. [^15] 


[^15]:  The last condition mentioned in the Sūtra indicates, that the place must have a river or tank, not wells only, as the purification by sipping water cannot be performed without help, with water from wells.
