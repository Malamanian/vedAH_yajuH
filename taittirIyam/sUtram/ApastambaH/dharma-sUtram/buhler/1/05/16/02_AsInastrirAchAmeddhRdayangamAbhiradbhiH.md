2. Sitting he shall sip water (for purification) thrice, the water penetrating to his heart. [^2] 


[^2]:  Manu II, 60 and 62; V, 139; and Yājñ. I, 20 and 27; Weber. Ind. Stud. X, 165. Haradatta observes, that the further particulars regarding purification by sipping water must be supplied from other Smṛtis. The rule quoted by him is as follows: 'The performer should be sitting in a pure place, not on a seat, except when sipping water after dinner, and should sip thrice from his hand water which is free from bubbles and foam, and which he has attentively regarded, in such a quantity as would cover a Māṣa-bean. p. 58 The water sipped by a Brahman should reach his heart, that sipped by a Kṣatriya the throat, and that sipped by a Vaiśya the palate. A Śūdra sips once as much as to wet his tongue.'
