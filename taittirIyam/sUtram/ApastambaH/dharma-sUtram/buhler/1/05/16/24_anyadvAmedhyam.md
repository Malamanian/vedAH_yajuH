24. Or any other unclean substance. [^14] 


[^14]:  Haradatta quotes a passage from Baudhāyana, which enumerates as 'unclean things' here intended, 'hair, worms or beetles, nail-parings, excrements of rats.' The rule must be understood as the preceding, i.e. in case these things have been cooked with the food.
