1. A Śūdra touches him, (then he shall leave off eating). [^1] 


[^1]:  17. 'Some say, that this Sūtra indicates that the touch of a Śūdra does not defile at any other time but at dinner, whilst others hold that a Śūdra's touch defiles always, and that the Sūtra is intended to indicate an excess of impurity, if it happens at dinnertime.'--Haradatta.
