20. During the spring festival and the festival (of Indra), in the month of Āṣāḍha (June-July), the study of an Anuvāka is forbidden. [^10] 


[^10]:  According to Haradatta, Āpastamba uses the word Anuvāka in order to indicate that smaller portions of the Veda may be studied. Others think, that by Anuvāka, the Saṃhitā and the Brāhmaṇa are meant, and that the study of the Aṅgas is permitted. The Vasantotsava, or spring festival, which, according to the Dramas, was, in olden times, kept all over India, falls, according to Haradatta, on the thirteenth of the first half of Caitra, about the beginning of April.
