1. After having performed the Upākarma for studying the Veda on the full moon of the month' Srāvaṇa (July-August), he shall for one month not study in the evening. [^1] 


[^1]:  9. The Upākarma is the ceremony which is performed every year at the beginning of the course of study. It is in fact the solemn opening of the Brahmanic term. 'Because Āpastamba uses the word evening (i.e. first part of the night) it is not sinful to study later in the night.'--Haradatta. Manu IV, 95; Yājñ. I, 142, 143; Weber, Ind. Stud. X. 130 and 134.
