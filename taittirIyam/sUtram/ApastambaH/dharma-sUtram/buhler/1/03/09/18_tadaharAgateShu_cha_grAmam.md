18. And if outcasts have entered the village, he shall not study on that day, [^10] 


[^10]:  Haradatta explains Bāhya, 'outcasts,' by 'robbers, such as Ugras and Niṣādas.' But, I think, it means simply such outcasts as live in the forest or outside the village in the Vādī, like the Dhers, Mahārs, Māngs of the present day. Most of these tribes however, are or were given to thieving. See Kullūka on Manu X, 2 9, and the Petersburg Dict. s. v.
