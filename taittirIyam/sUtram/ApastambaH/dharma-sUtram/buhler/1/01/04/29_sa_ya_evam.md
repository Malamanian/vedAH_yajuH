29. The student who thus entirely fixes his mind there (in the teacher's family), has thereby performed all acts which yield rewards (such as the Jyotiṣṭoma), and also those which must be performed by a householder. [^15] 


[^15]:  The Sūtra refers to a naiṣṭhika brahmacārin or professed student, who never leaves his teacher's family, and never enters any other order; and it declares his merit to be equal to that of one who becomes a householder. Manu II, 243, 244; Yājñ. I, 49, 50.
