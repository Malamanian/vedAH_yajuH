16. After having kindled the fire, and having swept the ground around (the altar), he shall place [^9]  the sacred fuel on the fire every morning and evening, according to the prescription (of the Gṛhya-sūtra).


[^9]:  Some explain, instead of 'after having swept the ground around the altar,' &c., 'after having raked the scattered brands into a heap.'--Haradatta.
