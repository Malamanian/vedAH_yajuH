25. Bringing all he obtains to his teacher, he shall go begging with a vessel in the morning and in the evening, (and he may) beg (from everybody) except low-caste people unfit for association (with Āryas) and Abhiśastas. [^9]  


[^9]:  Regarding the explanation of the term Abhiśasta, see below, I, 7, 21, 17. Haradatta: 'Apapātras are called those born from a high-caste mother and a low-caste father, such as washermen. For their cooking vessels &c. are unfit for the use of the four castes. . . . Since Āpastamba says, In the evening and in the morning, food obtained in the evening must not be used for the morning meal, nor food obtained in the morning for the evening meal."' Manu II, 182, 183, 185; Āśv. Gṛ. Sū. I, 22, 4. See also Gopatha-brāhmaṇa I, 2, 6.
