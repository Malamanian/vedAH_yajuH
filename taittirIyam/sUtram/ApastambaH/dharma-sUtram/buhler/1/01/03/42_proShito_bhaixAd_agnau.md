42. If (the pupil) is on a journey, he shall throw [^18]  a part of the alms into the fire and eat (the remainder).


[^18]:  This rule holds good if no Śrotriyas are near. If Śrotriyas are to be found, Sūtra 34 applies. Agni, the god of fire, is considered to be of the Brahminical caste, and hence he takes the place of the teacher or of the Śrotriyas. See also Manu II, 247, p. 14 248, and the passages collected from the Brāhmaṇas, by Prof. Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, 39.
