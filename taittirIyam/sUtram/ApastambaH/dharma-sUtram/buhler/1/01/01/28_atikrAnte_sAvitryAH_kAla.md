28. If the proper time for the initiation has passed, he shall observe for the space of two months [^17]  the duties of a student, as observed by those who are studying the three Vedas.


[^17]:  The meaning is, he shall keep all the restrictions imposed upon a student, as chastity, &c, but that he shall not perform the fire-worship or service to a teacher, nor study. Manu II, 39; XI. 192, Yājñ. I, 38; Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 101.
