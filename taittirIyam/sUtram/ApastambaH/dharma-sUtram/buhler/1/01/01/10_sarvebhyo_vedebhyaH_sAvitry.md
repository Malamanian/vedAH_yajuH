10. A Brāhmaṇa declares that the Gāyatrī is learnt for the sake of all the (three) Vedas. [^6] 


[^6]:  The object of the Sūtra is to remove a doubt whether the ceremony of initiation ought to be repeated for each Veda, in case a man desires to study more than one Veda. This repetition is declared to be unnecessary, except, as the commentator adds, in the case of the Atharva-veda, for which, according to a passage of a Brāhmaṇa, a fresh initiation is necessary. The latter rule is given in the Vaitāna-sūtra I, 1, 5.
