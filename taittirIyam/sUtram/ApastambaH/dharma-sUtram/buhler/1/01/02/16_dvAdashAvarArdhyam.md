16. Twelve years (should be) the shortest time (for his residence with his teacher). [^5] 


[^5]:  The commentator declares that in Manu III, 1, the expression until he has learnt it,' must be understood in this sense, that the pupil may leave his teacher, if he has learnt the Veda, after twelve years' study, never before. But compare also Āśv. Gṛ. Sū. I, 22, 3.
