8. He who meditates on him, and everywhere and always lives according to his (commandments), and who, full of devotion, sees him who is difficult to be seen and subtle, will rejoice in (his) heaven. [^8] 


[^8]:  Haradatta explains the word viṣṭap, 'heaven,' by 'pain-freed greatness,' apparently misled by a bad etymology. The heaven of the Ātman is, of course, liberation, that state where the individual soul becomes merged in the Brahman or Paramātman, which is pure essence, intelligence and joy.
