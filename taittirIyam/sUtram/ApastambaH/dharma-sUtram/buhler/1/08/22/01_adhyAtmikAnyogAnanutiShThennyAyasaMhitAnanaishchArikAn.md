[^1]:  22. The knowledge of the Vedānta and the means which prepare men for the knowledge of the Ātman, the 'Self, the universal soul,' are placed in this Paṭala at the head of the penances, because they are most efficacious for the removal of all sin. The means are absence of anger &c., which are enumerated I, 8, 23, 6.
