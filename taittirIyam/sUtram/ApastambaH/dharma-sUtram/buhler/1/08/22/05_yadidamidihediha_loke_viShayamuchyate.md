5. Despising all that which in this world is called an object (of the senses) a wise man shall strive after the (knowledge of the) Ātman. [^5] 


[^5]:  It seems to me that Haradatta's explanation of the words 'idam idi ha idi ha' is wrong. They ought to be divided thus, 'idamid, iha id, iha loke.' The general sense remains the same, and there is no necessity to assume very curious and otherwise unknown Vedic forms.
