2. He, who is intelligence itself and subtler than the thread of the lotus-fibre, pervades the universe, and who, unchangeable and larger than the earth, contains the universe; he, who is different from the knowledge of this world, obtained by the senses and identical with its objects, possesses the highest (form consisting of absolute knowledge). From him, who divides himself, spring all (created) bodies. He is the primary cause, he is eternal, he is unchangeable. [^1] 


[^1]:  23. This Sūtra again contains a description of the Paramātman. The translation strictly follows the commentary, though the explanation, given in the latter, is open to objections.
