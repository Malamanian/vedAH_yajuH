2. On failure of sons the nearest Sapiṇḍa (takes the inheritance). [^2] 


[^2]:  Haradatta gives in his commentary a full summary of the rules on the succession of remoter relations. One point only deserves special mention. He declares that it is the opinion of Āpastamba, that widows cannot inherit. In this he is probably right, as Āpastamba does not mention them, and the use of the p. 134 masculine singular 'sapiṇḍaḥ' in the text precludes the possibility of including them under that collective term. It seems to me certain, that Āpastamba, like Baudhāyana, considered women, especially widows, unfit to inherit.
