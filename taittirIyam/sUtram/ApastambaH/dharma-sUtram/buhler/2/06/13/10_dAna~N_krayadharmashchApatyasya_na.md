11. The gift (or acceptance of a child) and the right to sell (or buy) a child are not recognised. [^5] 


[^5]:  Haradatta thinks that, as most other Smṛtis enumerate the adopted son, and 'the son bought' in their lists of substitutes for lawful sons of the body, Āpastamba's rule can refer only to the gift or sale of an eldest son, or to the gift or sale of a child effected by a woman. Though it is possible that he may be right in his interpretation, it remains a remarkable fact that Āpastamba does not mention the 'twelve kinds of sons,' which are known to other Smṛtis.
