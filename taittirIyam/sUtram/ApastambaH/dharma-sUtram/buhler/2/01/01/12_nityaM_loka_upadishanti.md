12. And they declare (that this rite which is known) amongst the people (must be performed) every (year). [^8] 


[^8]:  They, i.e. the Śiṣṭas, those learned in the law. 'Another commentator says, the rite which will be taught (in the following Sūtra), and which is known from the usage of the learned, is constant, i.e. must be performed in every case. That it is what the "learned" declare.'--Haradatta. The latter explanation of the Sūtra is adopted by Mahādeva.
