2. He shall eat at the two (appointed) times, (morning and evening) [^2] 


[^2]:  Haradatta thinks that this Sūtra is intended to prevent householders from having more than two meals a day, and to keep them from gluttony. Others are of opinion that its object is to keep householders from excessive fasting, and to make them perform the Prāṇāgnihotra at either meal. At the Prāṇāgnihotra the sacrificer eats five mouthfuls invoking successively, whilst he p. 100 eats, the five vital airs. At the first mouthful he says, 'To Prāṇa svāhā;' at the second, 'To Apāna svāhā,' &c.
