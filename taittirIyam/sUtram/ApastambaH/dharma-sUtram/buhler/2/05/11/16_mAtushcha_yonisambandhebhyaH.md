16. Nor to one related (within six degrees) on the mother's or (the father's) side. [^9] 


[^9]:  The term yonisambandha, 'related (within six degrees),' corresponds to the more common Sapiṇḍa of Manu, Yājñavalkya, and others; see the definitions given below, II, 6, 15, 2. In Āpastamba's terminology Sapiṇḍa has probably a more restricted sense. It seems very doubtful whether Haradatta's explanation of ka, translated by 'or,' is correct, and whether his interpolation of 'the father's' ought to be admitted. Probably Sūtra 15 refers to the father's side, and Sūtra 16 to the mother's side.
