1. If the suitor pays money (for his bride) according to his ability, and marries her (afterwards), that (marriage is called) the Āsura-rite. [^1] 


[^1]:  12. Manu III, 31; Yājñ. I, 61. It must be understood that, at this rite, a regular sale of the bride must take place. If a suitor merely gives presents to the bride, that is not an Āsura-marriage.
