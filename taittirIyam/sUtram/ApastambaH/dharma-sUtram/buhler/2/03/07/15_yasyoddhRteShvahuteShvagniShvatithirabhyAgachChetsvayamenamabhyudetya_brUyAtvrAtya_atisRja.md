15. If a guest comes, after the fires have been placed (on the altar), but before the oblations have been offered, (the host) himself shall approach him and say to him: 'O faithful fulfiller of thy vows give me permission; I wish to sacrifice.' Then he shall sacrifice, after having received permission. A Brāhmaṇa declares that he commits a sin if he sacrifices without permission. [^11] 


[^11]:  Haradatta states that the Brāhmaṇa mentioned in the text is the Āharvaṇa-brāhmaṇa. See Atharva-veda. XV, 11-12.
