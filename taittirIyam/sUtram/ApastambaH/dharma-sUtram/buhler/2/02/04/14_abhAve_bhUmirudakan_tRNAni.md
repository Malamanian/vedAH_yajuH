14. If there is no food, earth, water, grass, and a kind word, indeed, never fall in the house of a good man. Thus (say those who know the law). [^11] 


[^11]:  Manu III, 101 Yājñ. I, 107. As read in the text, the first line of the verse has one syllable in excess. This irregularity would disappear if tṛṇā, the Vedic form of the nom. ace. plural, were read for tṛṇāni, and it seems to me not improbable that tṛṇāni is a correction made by a Pandit who valued grammatical correctness higher than correctness of metre.
