20. With the seventh and eighth Mantras (Balis [^12]  must be offered to Dharma and Adharma) behind the fire, and must be placed the one to the north of the other.


[^12]:  The first six offerings constitute the Devayajña or Vaiśvadeva, which is offered in the fire. Now follow the Bali-offerings, which are merely placed on the ground. 'Behind the fire' means to the east of the fire'; for the sacrificer must face the east.
