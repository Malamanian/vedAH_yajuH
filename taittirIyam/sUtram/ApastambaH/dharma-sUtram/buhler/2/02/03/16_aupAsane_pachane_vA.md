16. (At the Vaiśvadeva sacrifice) he shall offer the oblations with his hand, (throwing them) into the kitchen-fire or into the sacred (Gṛhya)-fire, and reciting (each time one of) the first six Mantras (prescribed in the Nārāyaṇī Upaniṣad). [^9] 


[^9]:  It is a disputed point with the commentators whether every Brāhmaṇa may offer the Vaiśvadeva in the common kitchen-fire, or those persons only who do not keep a sacred domestic fire. The six Mantras, which are given Taitt. Ār. X, 67, 1, are: 1. Agnaye svāhā, 'to Agni svāhā'; 2. Somāya svāhā, 'to Soma svāhā'; 3. Viśvebhyo devebhyaḥ svāhā, 'to all the gods svāhā'; 4. Dhruvāya bhūmaya svāhā, 'to Dhruva Bhūma svāhā'; 5. Dhruvakṣitaye svāhā, 'to Dhruvakṣiti svāhā'; 6. Acyutakṣitaye svāhā, 'to Acyutakṣiti svāhā.' Haradatta adds that some add a seventh formula, addressed to Agni sviṣṭakṛt, 'to the fire which causes the proper performance of the sacrifice,' while others leave out the second Mantra and give that addressed to Agni sviṣṭakṛt the sixth place. This latter is the order given in the Calcutta edition of the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka.
