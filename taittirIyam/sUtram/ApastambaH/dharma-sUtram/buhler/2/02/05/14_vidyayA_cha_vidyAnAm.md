14. (He shall not revile one branch of) sacred learning by (invidiously comparing it with) another. [^8] 


[^8]:  'For example, he shall not say, "The Ṛj-veda is sweet to the ear, the other Vedas grate on the ear," or "the Taittirīya-veda is a Śākhā consisting of leavings," or "the Brāhmaṇa proclaimed by Yājñavalkya is of modern origin."'--Haradatta. The second sentence refers to the story that Yājñavalkya vomited the Black Yajur-veda, and his fellow-students, becoming partridges, picked it up. Regarding the third sentence, see Vārttika on Pāṇini IV, 3, 105, and Max Müller's History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, P. 363.
