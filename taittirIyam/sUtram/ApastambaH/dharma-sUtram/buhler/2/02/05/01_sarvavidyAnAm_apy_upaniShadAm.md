1. On the day on which, beginning the study of the whole sacred science, the Upaniṣads (and the rest, he performs the Upākarma in the morning) he shall not study (at night). [^1] 


[^1]:  5. This rule refers to the Upākarma, to be performed yearly by householders. In our days, too, the custom is observed, and the whole Brahminical community change on this occasion their Jenvīs or sacrificial cords in the month of Srāvaṇa. The adherents of the various Śākhās of the Vedas, however, perform the ceremony on different days. According to Haradatta, the Upaniṣads are named, in order to show that they are of the highest importance. See also Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa X, 3, 5, 12.
