9. A Śūdra (who commits adultery) with a woman of one of the first three castes shall suffer capital punishment. [^3] 


[^3]:  Manu VIII, 374; Yājñ. II, 286. According to Haradatta, this refers to a Śūdra servant who seduces a woman committed to his charge. In other cases the punishment prescribed, II, 10, 26,10, is to take effect. The same opinion is expressed by Gautama.
