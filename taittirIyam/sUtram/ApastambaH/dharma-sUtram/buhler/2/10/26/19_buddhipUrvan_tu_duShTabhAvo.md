19. But he does it intentionally with a bad purpose, he must be fined. [^13] 


[^13]:  'The punishment must be proportionate to his property and the greatness of his offence. The term "with a bad purpose" is added, because he who has been sent by his teacher (to such a place) should not be punished.'--Haradatta. Manu VIII, 354; Yājñ. II, 284.
