21. The following persons defile the company if they are invited to a funeral-sacrifice, viz. a leper, a bald man, the violator of another man's bed, the son of a Brāhmaṇa who follows the profession of a Kṣatriya, and the son of (a Brāhmaṇa who by marrying first a Śūdra wife had himself become) a Śūdra, born from a Brāhmaṇa woman. [^11] 


[^11]:  Manu III, 152-166, and particularly 153 and 154 Yājñ. I. 222-224. Haradatta's explanation of the word 'Śūdra' by 'a Brāhmaṇa who has become a Śūdra' is probably not because the son of a real Śūdra and of a Brāhmaṇa female is a Kaṇḍāla, and has been disposed of by the preceding Sūtra.
