1. Formerly men and gods lived together in this world. Then the gods in reward of their sacrifices went to heaven, but men were left behind. Those men who perform sacrifices in the same manner as the gods did, dwell (after death) with the gods and Brahman in heaven. Now (seeing men left behind), Manu revealed this ceremony, which is designated by the word Śrāddha (a funeral-oblation). [^1] 


[^1]:  16. 'Intending to give the rules regarding the monthly Śrāddha, he premises this explanatory statement in order to praise that sacrifice.'--Haradatta.
