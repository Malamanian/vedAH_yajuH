13. Men of the first three castes, who are pure and truthful, may be allowed to play there. [^7] 


[^7]:  Having played there, they shall give a fixed sum to the gambling-house keeper and go away. The latter shall, every day or every month or every year, give that gain to the king. And the king shall punish those who play elsewhere or quarrel in the assembly-house.'--Haradatta.
