11. The knowledge which Śūdras and women possess is the completion (of all study). [^9] 


[^9]:  Manu II, 223. The meaning of the Sūtra is, that men ought not to study solely or at first such Śāstras as women or Śūdras also learn, but that at first they must study the Veda. See Manu II, 168. The knowledge which women and Śūdras possess is dancing, music, and other branches of the Arthaśāstra.
